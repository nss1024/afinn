27-Mar-2020	this is a fun app but there are some curse words in videos. but if you put your birthday 2008 or up then it will give you kid friendly videos with a private account. i think this app is super cool and you should give it a try. also when you download it you dont have to make an account to watch videos you can just watch them but you cant like anything. anyway i highly recommend this app for at least 9 or older. hope you enjoy!!	15
12-Apr-2020	this app is amazing! i honestly think you should have a filter for the sad little children who play this game. there's a ton of 13+ audios and videos that innocent children can run into. there should be a 13+ switch in the app settings for parents to use. and also, i think you shouldn't have a problem with lgbtq. people can like who they want and you shouldn't ban them from streams if they do so.	-3
12-Apr-2020	hi, since i got tiktok a few days ago, it was pretty normal but when i saw a video once and go back to the same video, it lags like it doesn't show me the full video again. when that happens, i just go down and go to up to the same video for the whole thing again but it just lag. my internet is on but i don't get it why it keeps happening over and over.	1
30-Mar-2020	if you follow many people it says you're following too fast and doesn't let you follow until 1 day later. same thing for liking videos. also, if you like comments the likes don't go to total likes. also, it takes up 15 gigs of my internal storage. also, sometimes you can't hear sound because the sound doesn't have rights in your country. lastly, there's a lot of false info ppl say on the app that tiktok allows to happen. oh and also my vids never got on the for you page even though i put a #	7
23-Apr-2020	hi tiktok team, i had a tiktok account with the id (@usernameremoved). i am giving you this rating because my tiktok account is not working properly. i already complain regarding this issue in the past but no action is taken from your side that's why i have given low rating. it seems like my tiktok account is freezed. the view and the like count of the video are not increasing. please solve this issue soon. i am waiting for your response. i will change my rating if my problem is solved .	0
01-Apr-2020	i have open tiktok account.but after few days my sim does a problem.for a reason i delete my tik tok accound.when i download tiktok again, i was unable to open my account because i change my sim.for this reason,my number also change and i also forget my password. now the main problem is i am unable to open my old account. can you tell me the solution please	-8
13-Apr-2020	i'm not gonna lie, i used to be on tiktok all the time! it had a lot of great videos from aspiring creators! not just the dances..and that's what i'm writing this review about... tiktok used to be great! i had fun, and loved making videos. but now? it changed. now all you see are the same dances and the same songs over and over again. i don't like them. i miss all of the artists and cosplayers, all the comedians and memes, all the fun chains..and almost all of that is gone. ðÿ¥º q~q	20
15-Apr-2020	my stars would be higher but i cant get green screen because the effect doesn't work in my region and also it's not available on my device so tiktok this is a problem you need to fix everybody she should be able to use the effects no matter were they are and what device that use some people don't have enough money to get the device that works with green screen and a lot of people want to post gacha life stuff like that and they can't do that because most people use green screen	-1
10-Apr-2020	hi, i'm 25 years old. i tried to install the app. no problem. but after that, the app does not want to connect to internet. i tried many way (unistall, reinstall, clear cach, check permissions, change to wifi or mobile data...) i have a good stable connexion. please help me	8
10-Apr-2020	tiktok is one of the easiest apps to control. there's no problems to fix. it's easy to get tiktok famous because of the for you page. it's also very helpful. there's so much things you can learn from it. from life hacks to diys they help out in your life. there's also so much categories to pick from. to me tiktok is is the best app on my phone.	7
14-Apr-2020	uninstalling. absolutely sick and tired of all the effing notifications. by the end of the day, there have been 15 notifications sometimes. that's worse than ads. i have all my settings correctly ticked, and still i get notification after notification. no, thanks.	-7
12-Apr-2020	i really enjoy this app but i don't understand why the green screen isn't availabe for my device. i mean why can't it be available for all devices? also it would be way better to be able to create folders for my favourites, i have thousands of them and i never find the one i want to show my friends. also: i've had the function "record" over a video a few weeks ago, but when i updated the app it disappeared. it would be great if i could get it again. but all in all i really love the app!	14
11-Apr-2020	very very nice app. i must say that this app is very helpful for time pass in common words. we can view the contacts with whom we were not in contact for so long. people can view each others' videos and like them and even comment on them. if we want to keep them private or on friends mode then also it will work. keep it up the makers. i love this app very much. i don't care about my likers or my followers i just love to make videos and see them or forward to some one else. please download this app and give them highest rating and review	19
08-Apr-2020	great app, but 4 stars because i can't use some effects because it says my phone can't support it or something like that. my guess is that it doesn't work because i have an android. i would really like to use all effects!! if this is changed, i will give 5 stars!!ðÿ˜ thank you!	8
09-Apr-2020	good for me and for all of us. this is good app peoples are showing their creativity like dialogue. acting. dancing and so on. and this is the app by which other people know you . and many things â¤ðÿ˜š i love this app. but one problem is there we can not send messages until both the person followed each other's	9
31-Mar-2020	the app is amazing i have been using it for the past few months now and there was no problem at all. but recently tiktok has been saying "you're tapping to fast, take a break" and it's been really annoying because i want to like videos and i'm not able to. so please fix this. thank you.	3
27-Mar-2020	the content isn't shared equally due to shadowbanning. which means some content doesn't get shared at all.then the app will delete videos without the courtesy of providing an explanation for the removal of ones content. lack of feedback on such videos is not helpful, cause creators need to know what they did wrong so that they may correct it in the future. it would be nice if there was a feature like a guide to becoming more popular on tik-tok that would suggest video ideas tailored 4 each user.	8
14-Apr-2020	worst app ......how many times i reported my problems to the tiktok team but they didn't revert atleast once ....i am not getting from past two months ..i never broke any guidelines and rules then too they keep my videos under view....feeling like totally wasting my time on this app ..they make famous those who are already famous or the dirtiest content..	-1
19-Apr-2020	tiktok is very good app . it's a very nice fantastic stage to show your talent and skill . i like so much this app. but unfortunately still i didn't get any popularity, people didn't like my video, they like only beautiful girls and boys video and also celebrities videos. they're not looking actual talent . so i am giving tiktok 4 star. sorry tiktok	22
11-Apr-2020	really fun and people are surprisingly super kind. its awesome seeing people's talents, goofy ideas, and just all the diverse qualities of one another. all the challenges are fun and uplifting especially during this social distance stage in life. and for the most part, this is a positive app that makes me smile and feel confident to share some of my life with strangers â¤âœœâ¤	24
01-Apr-2020	i'd like a better way to search for the kinds of content i want to see, i keep tapping on tags to see if i'll be able to see content related to tags for example, & they don't click through. i also think i should be able to click once on the fyp to follow people rather than having to click through on their name (although keepi g that as an option is essential). i keep getting videos repeated in my follow feed & that's annoying. i actually rather liked getting the alert that i should have a break	6
15-Apr-2020	typically have a really good time on this app, but the recent updates changed the layout and i keep accidentally selecting "not interested" instead of adding it to my favorites since that button used to be at the bottom. very frustrating to know i'm missing out on content i really like to see.	1
16-Apr-2020	i love tik tok. but they changed when you are trying to save a video from the bottom button and now that is the dislike button! why? now videos i try to save automatically go into my dislike. it wouldn't be a problem if there was a way to fix that and get the video back but there is not a way that i can find.	4
19-Apr-2020	i loved the app then the videos that it was recommending me was toxic, i couldn't handle it, i didn't want to watch videos like that, i wanted to watch funny videos. i done my best to like funny videos and it still pushed toxic videos then toxic videos make more toxic videos. tiktok will become so toxic and you do have some talented people on it. i think you need a filter on what people can talk about it. where videos get removed and cant upload.	5
20-Apr-2020	until the last update it was good. now i can't even edit the musical or effect properly because whenever i post it the songs are out of place and so are the effects. the editing needs to be fixed, i can't even use tik tok due to this bug. - music wont be in edited placement - effects won't be in edited placement - when reviewing videos the video stops but music keeps playing on some weird reason. needs to be fixed	-3

29-Apr-2020	tik tok is amazing but this app is not promoting videos that are good in content including expressions and most imp thing is it doesn't support small users and don't provide them views .views only last for around 50 that's it why this app doesn't support small users . don't viral those videos that have sex message involved don't viral those videos that have nothing message and are waste . please look at those who gives actual and nice expressions on sounds and audio not those who just dance on.	15
05-May-2020	dear tik tok team. i love this app but i have some problem using the app as i am very active in it but don't get more than 100 views on my videos. even after posting the problem with tik tok team. the app but my problems is not solved i see some videos with no beauty and creativity. but they getting millions of views it's shocking please solved the problem . i love tik tok team and want more views and more likes on my videos. so please help me tik tok i'd - @usernameremoved	7

28-Apr-2020	now i can't duet anything. you guys need to fix this. there's some amazing singers that i would like to duet, but when i tap the duet symbol it says "couldnt download, try again later". can you guys fix this please. and also can you stop taking down black creators tiktoks when they address people for saying the n word. and take down the videos of white people saying the n word. this makes me think that this app is 100% racist. so please do better. thank you.	9
31-Mar-2020	i love this app !! but a few features that are very necessary are missing : â€¢in direct msg between me and my friend it is very useful to be able to double click a msg to like it in the conversation or at least to be able to reply to a specific msg sent like the feature whatsapp has. â€¢ why can't i share a picture or video in direct ? â€¢ the caption below the video and the share/like/cmnt are taking a huge part of the video there has to be a way to hide and show them when needed.	15
19-Apr-2020	ultimate time passer. comedy, education, tutorials, art, cooking, special fx, cosplay ,urban exploring, electrical, plumbing, landscaping,, you pretty much think of it and there's some type video on the topic. fun! your own videos are super easy to load whether videoing straight from the tik tok app or you can easily load a video from wherever you got it stored. it's really easy to add filters and sounds from the app, just as much fun editing and posting videos as it is watching them.	15
21-Apr-2020	while fun to see all the different cosplayers. the app is super inconsistent with it's updates. some people have some features while other don't... tik tok shadow bans your content if you're not pretty enough... thought it was a myth til i saw it first hand... entertaining, but wish it was better.	8
19-Apr-2020	this app is a great and fun app,i've had it for almost two year and it's always filled with good content.but i have one problem about the app the disappoints me,the fact that all the good effect never work on android devices,example being i wanna use the green screen but it keeps saying my device is not compatible.i really wish that my device was compatible.	10
08-Apr-2020	it's amazing, i absolutely love how there are so many things to do. however, i have been waiting several hours to be able to like a video. i have restarted my phone, closed the app multiple times, and leave it alone for a few minutes but i am still unable to like the video which is annoying.	2
15-Apr-2020	every single video loads and loads towards the end and does not play the last 10 ish seconds so if i want to watch the whole video without it being interuppted i have to download it onto my phone to watch it which is very annoying. one video does not play the whole way through. please fix this issue soon!	2
01-Apr-2020	its a fun app, i just wish they could update the favorites option. u can favorite videos and save them to watch again or show others, but its inconvenient for 2 reasons. 1) it doesnt have an option for me to section off different types of posts like lets say instagram has. instagram allows you to make folders to save posts and title the folders. i wish tiktok had the same. 2) lets say i save a post and go into my favorites to see that the post was deleted. i cant unsave it. :(	18
29-Mar-2020	this app is wonderful but i can't understand what's happening means my followers they are not increasing it just ten and when i am seeing my all followers list there are many more and just one girl started following me and i checked under my profile it's ten again and no body unfollowed. i just thought i should update it and then i was seeing videos and i remember that it was updating so i opened play store and it was installing. then i was trying to open it at bottom it came "app not installed"	1
28-Apr-2020	i admit it has a great community. but it's the second time tiktok removed my account completely. i've not even recorded a single video and just use it for exploring and saving my favorite videos. it's probably because i use vpn to connect. anyway they don't have the right to remove my account without any warning. however, they dictatorship and censorship policies had been peoven to everyone so i'm not surprised :)	6
22-Apr-2020	i would give this a 5 star if i didnt see half-naked girls on my fyp. please start removing the videos like those, because their fould be perverts seeing them. please fix this and doing other things. but overall the app is a great app. it is good for many. but you all need to take down videos of girls saying kill all men, and saying men are stupid, and dont deserve rights. but this is needing to stop. but other than these 2 things the app is super good, and is a great way to talk and post.	16
22-Apr-2020	i am very disappointed with this error because there are some issues in my account like there is no increase in like and followers. i think that my account is freeze so this issue was happened. i was complaining regarding this issue but there is no update. so please resolve this... my id is- @usernameremoved.	0
27-Mar-2020	i'm having a problem with me not being able to upload. the app keeps on asking me to grant permissions that i have already granted and it also tells me to close any other apps that may be using my camera and to reset my device. i've have done this and have searched up solutions to this problem numerous times but it never works. help?	2
03-Apr-2020	spectacular! very amazing also. i really really like it. there is reeally cool stuff om it! and when i first got on tiktock i thought it was really nothing,but then i started to go on it more amd more and i loved it now! so i think more people should go on this app its really cool trust me!!! this app is very amazing and i know that its gonna be more accoplished sooner in the future, im very sure.	18
14-Apr-2020	it is too good and it is a platform to show your talent and opportunities for those who are interested in acting or any kind of talent to explore , develope and share. but in there is one problem when i give the feedback or report a problem there is no reply or answer.	6
13-Apr-2020	it is a good app, however the green screen affect does not work on my device it says it is not compatible which is extremely annoying i have a samsung a10. the app on a whole is ok i haven't had any issues personally but i can see how it could become a platform for bullying, from seeing some of the comments on peoples videos, perhaps you could possibly introduce an option which doesnt allow offensive comments, but as i previously stated i have not had any issues with that area personally.	0
15-Apr-2020	i this app so much but recently i am facing a problem in it which is that whenever i make a video it plays as it as the song is adding in it well before posting but when i play this video in my gallery always the very starting part of the video skipped ..even though i installed this app again and again but still i am facing the same problem......plz fix this bugðÿ”ªðÿ”ªðÿ”ªðÿ”ª	-4
17-Apr-2020	app is very fun. but this app is disappointing me because without any reason my tiktok account is freezing by tiktok team first of all i do not upload any bad , any harmful videos i also active on tiktok everytime i reported a problem but still my account is freezed but still tiktok no respond. i think tiktok team is very careless irresponsible for small creator and tiktok team give too much focus on popular	-14
19-Apr-2020	i do love this app, however, it could use some useful tools such as allowing caption editing after posting (some people do not like misspelled words in their caption), being able to reapply a sound to a video if the original creator rebukes their sound would be a considerate feature, and we need a way to easily get to our favorite creators. organization is very key for an app to receive a five star rating from me.	9
15-Apr-2020	i love love this app ! but please for the love of god fix my problem. i logged into my friends account (she knew) for a joke. and then i logged back into mine and i kept getting notifications from her acc to my phone. and then i tried everything and tried to log in on my sisters acc to see if it work do the same and it does..	11
18-Apr-2020	i think there might be something wrong about the recording like i record my dance and my dance really go exact to its sound but when im finished i check out my recording and there's so wrong about it. the music wont play normally, its just keeps left behind.. and every videos i added on favorites. days later i just found out it was deleted and i dont understand why would they do that. some of the videos showed up on for you section are already watched and they keep showing in again and again.	-2
23-Mar-2020	i love this app so much it has so many different sounds and music that you can make videos to and dance. the only thing i don't like is when they take down some of my videos but i have full clothing on just dancing while others have bathing suits on. i also don't like when i had to master reset my phone it stopped me from logging in so i had to make a new account. other than that, this is a fun appðÿ¥³	10
07-Apr-2020	an ad in an app keeps making me click on this when i'm trying to swipe up to access my phone controls. since you want me to download and use this app so much, i'll uninstall and give one star. if i return to this app and actually want to use it, i will change this rating. key word: if.	2
29-Mar-2020	whenever i try to go on the app, it never allowes me to watch videos or do anything because for some reason all i see is the logo and then it takes me to the play store. i find this annoying because i can never be able to go on the app. what's going on tiktok???	7
19-Apr-2020	i like the app and use it often, but the bullying is getting worst and the stitch feature can help push it farther. its a interesting idea to have the stitch feature but the allow button is the same between duet, react, and stitch. it would be better if i could turn it on or off individually so i can let non-mutuals duet without fearing someone is going to steal my content and make fun of me.	4
16-Apr-2020	i am very disappointed with this error because there are some issues in my account like there is no increase in like and followers. i think that my account is freeze so this issue was happened. i was complaint regarding this issue but there is no update. so please resolve this..this is my id-@usernameremoved	0
19-Apr-2020	great app but major bias as to who's videos are seen. if you're not a stereotypical hot person (by the moderators standards) your videos are rarely pushed out to the public mainstream. basically, if you're not "hot" and showing some skin, the moderators don't push your content and even sometimes unfairly remove it and say it's a violation of "community guidelines," while 15 yo girls can dance like a skank. also, can't set duration on text in videos without it freezing on galaxy s20 ultra.	-1
13-Apr-2020	they moved the add to favorites button and i've already accidentally clicked not interested twice. they should at least let me get a chance to confirm or cancel the not interested button. besides that it's a pretty good app, i've been using it for over a year and i really enjoy it	11
02-Apr-2020	the app itself is alright, but good god, they have such a problem with censoring and banning their creators for no reason. the algorithm is all sorts of messy and they ban people who did nothing wrong while keeping disgusting people verified and on the app. it makes no sense and they need to take it seriously.	-11
19-Apr-2020	i personally love this app! but, sometimes i'm thinking of a new username and i try heaps but they're taken, and after a while i cant change my username! even if it's been 30 days aswell, so that why i rated this 4 stars, and if the creators are seeing this please tell me what to do. but in conclusion i definitely recommend this app	6
15-Apr-2020	i like this app but the new update really bothers me. the whole 'someone replied to a comment you liked' is really annoying, i've been getting notifications for the past day every five minutes because of this. some people are using it to get clout by saying the won't stop untill everyone follows them and it's stupid, please remove this feature or at least let us disable it.	2
25-Mar-2020	the app is awesome. i can make funny and co videos, get tons of likes,and look at others videos! i can chat with people close and far away, and it's very addictive! in a great way! i dont give 5 stars because the filters that i really want to use are only for iphones. androids dont get the same equality of tiktok as iphone.	8
26-Mar-2020	the only issue i've had is for some reason the app doesnt like my phone's mic, so any time i'm talking/singing in a video i have to be extra loud. otherwise, i love it. also if you get it you should definitely follow @usernameremoved (sorry about the shameless self promo but i thought it was funny lol)	9
10-Apr-2020	i loved this app but i want to delete the problems about the account that i sent to tiktok team and when i made another i'd the reported problems were same as it was in the previous i'd so if you will provide an option to delete those messages it will be a great help otherwise i will definitely dlt this app....and it should provide a new id with no reported problems my frnds have also dltd this app for this reason if it will be solved then we will download this app.hope tiktok will do something.	2
12-Apr-2020	fun app but the notifications are extremely annoying. i have the push notification set to off for all kinds of notifications in the settings. i'm still getting a bunch of notifications (sometimes 10 times a day). fix this please and i'll give you the 5 stars!!	1
17-Apr-2020	hello tiktok team, i love this app very much, it has fullon entertaining, emotional, learning,comedy etc etc. but the problem is that whenever i post my vdos, i get only 20-25 views don't know the reason why it is so. when i see most of the vdos which has nothing but there views are like very high dont know what is the reason behind that whatever i just request please look into this matter and if possible do something so that i get the views and likes. i love this app very much. regards chandra	10
19-Apr-2020	i have been using this app as a content producer for a few months and working hard to grab the eyeballs but the tiktok doesn't even promote newbies' video it doesn't even care to provide views so that on feels motivated. i request the team to at least give some importance to its new users too. rest, an amazing app to get engaged with.	8
01-Apr-2020	the effects are awesome but my problem is that i can't search anything! it keeps saying 'this feature is unavailable'! i've uninstalled and reinstalled it but it keeps saying the same thing. i've even googled it and i followed all the instructions but it doesn't work!	2
28-Mar-2020	when i accidentally like a video then i have to unlike it but it will take a second so i press the like again and then it un-likes but re-likes and then it's just a cycle and it gets pretty annoying by the time i get it un-liked and even if i lightly press it twice then it will light although i didn't do it on purpose. maybe my screen is just sensitive but i think it has something to do with the app. i would rate 5 stars but this minor problem can be quite annoying and a bit of a hassle. thanks	5
18-Apr-2020	i will give this app 4 stars because everything on this app is great and amazing but everytime i try to make a tiktok i record it and it seems fine but when i play it back its really delayed like the sound doesnt match the actual tiktok its like its off by a beat or something, i would just like that fixed ,thank you	14
19-Apr-2020	i love this app. i love that you can make videos, and watch other people's videos. i love all the filters in the sounds. so far i haven't had any problems except when i made an account i wasn't able to search videos or sounds. i deleted my account( at least i thought i did) and my account was still there. then let me make videos, and search videos. i would recommend highly recommend this app.	11
27-Mar-2020	terrible! when i made my account, i couldn't do anything! i couldn't comment, make a public video, follow people, or anything! i even gave the app all permissions! does anyone know how to fix this?! no tiktok, don't just tell me to "report the problem" because i already did.	1
05-Apr-2020	app won't let me sign up. just says i'm not eligible for some reason. i'm in my 20s so age should not be an issue but when ever i put my birthday in it just says not eligible. i've tried re installing the app, clearing cache and data restarting my phone but nothing is working. this is just not acceptable.	0
01-Apr-2020	hi this is such a good app but for some reason i can't see any of my videos and neither can my followers. i have an ok following but my most recent video hasn't gotten any views. i went on my other private account and it said that i haven't made any videos whatsoever. so that's super annoying. other than that i absalutley love this app, it's so entertaining and i can get lost in it for hours	8
27-Mar-2020	ok, this app is great i love it. but my only problem is that sometimes you know where your about to make a video and you can change the speed with those 5 or 4 buttons they keep disappearing and idk how to change the speed? so, can you pls try to fix that	7
01-Apr-2020	no network connection error. (works fine on web). still not fixed. still not fixed march 2nd. not fixed march 3rd. march 7th, not fixed. it's been months now and ita still not fixed. and i don't think it ever will.	2
24-Mar-2020	amazing app although, i had a problem. i got on this morning to check my video becuase last night it was at 500 views with 30 likes, so i went to check on it and it was gone and i had 9 videos up and then this morning there were 7 i cant figure out exactly what i did wrong to get my video removed this videos just like it i even followed community guidelines now tik tok tell please tell me why my video and another video i'm not sure which by why were they removed please tell i really wanna know.	4
07-May-2020	hello tiktok team, its a best flatworm to expose our talent, i love this very much but now my account is freezed, but i don't know why, i'm sad for that,, please give me solution for that,, so many times i done problem report but no useðÿ˜£ please slow my problem, and i hve only lessthan 500 views to my videos, but i have 150k followers, please solve my problem, give views to my videos, my tiktok id @usernameremoved	-1
04-Apr-2020	really good however, it's sometimes weird because of its updates. also, i miss musical.ly. i miss lipsinc content and all that. musical.ly was better but i don't have anything to really complain about tiktok only just that the updates are sometimes dumb. and let me write a longer comment people!	-3
17-Apr-2020	this app is nice but i don't understand why u can't trim your videos after recording.... and the annoying thing is after the recording u see trim on your corner but u can't use. why? at first i thought i needed update so i updated the app again but still the same ....i mean u guys should work on that	4
14-Apr-2020	i love this app and i spend hours in it. this is plateform where anybody can show their talent like dancing,singing,acting and dialogues etc. i rated only three stars becoz i made videos on tiktok and i got only 30 to 40views..its happening with me since 2years..i think my id has been freeze so plzz unfreeze my id n give more views on videos...i report so many times but i tiktok didnot any response.	7
01-Apr-2020	it seems good from comments but i don't know how to use it very well yet.i just recently downloaded the app and i have been trying to do the challenges but known is working. like beauty mode challenge.i need help with that and other challenges especially things related to makeup challenges. help a sister enjoy this app as well	14
19-Apr-2020	its really nice , but there is something about it that annoys me so much ðÿ˜–its when u open it right away (tiktok) it just up ok the screen like 20 people live like ! why do i care!? gosh it's just really annoying i would love for them to delete this update ! its overall really nice app , but getting worse	12
30-Mar-2020	i can download the app to chromebook and watch videos wont let me set up account, says i need to grant permissions, which i have done and still not allowing and just repeatedly says need to grant permissions. i have also uninstalled and installed again and again to see if it rectifies the problem with no success. edit... that is my problem i habe no profile because its not letting me set up as i have said for the above reasons	-6
01-Apr-2020	the first night i downloaded it i was able to view videos, however when i opened it the next day it wouldn't load and kept saying that there is no internet connection even though i have internet and even have my wifi on as well. really hope you guys can fix this.	1
01-Apr-2020	my experience on tiktok was quite good but on the other hand i dont feel like this was a good experience either. one of my suggestions for an update is to let you see who views your videos but haven't liked and to "decorate" the app for occasions like christmas or halloween and easter! either way, i would give this a 5 stars but there are some things that i think need an improvement.	12
13-Apr-2020	look its fun to flick through for a while but has a lot of glitches and the service team is slack and unhelpful. update: i have been waiting 7 months for a response to an issue with video editing with no communication from the "support" team. not worth it. walk away.	4
21-Mar-2020	my account got freezed i work so hard to make good content for this app but this app literally freeze my account again and again i sent this app so many messages requesting to unfreeze my account. this app don't respond at all and never solve your problem i would consider you guys to install any other content creator app at least that app won't do this with you . really so disappointing tiktok team ðÿ¥ºðÿ‘	-1
03-May-2020	dear tiktok team i have a problem with my live option. from some days my live features has been out from my id. i don't know why. so please tell me what is a problem why i'm not able to live streaming if my live features go to out to my mistakes then i apologize for this and i promised you from next i will mind it and we try to make tiktok safe and clean. it's my humble request to you please give me back live features... my tiktok id @usernameremoved thank's	-2
23-Apr-2020	it is really a awesome app , but i gave 1 star because once i disabled auto update but after that it is still updating , automatically.. then i disabled every permission and data using permissions, but it would still updating automatically.. why this happens , it would consume very much data	4
26-Apr-2020	hey i just love this app very much and it really makes me time pass day by day, but i have some problems that i want to share with the developers of tiktok app. " that i am not gaining more views and likes through the vedios which i will upload in this app. " so please make a solution for this problem. my id on tiktok @usernameremoved. ðÿ™	9
14-Apr-2020	i would like to say that i really like tik tok, it's very fun to make videos. my only problem is that for iphones it's very easy to use the editor options for this app. while androids have to use other apps to actually edit the videos. iphone users have the adjust button to help them with adjusting their videos (or edit the video, by cutting out maybe 2 seconds of a particular video) to match up with the sound etc etc. while androids (like i stated before) have to go use other editing apps.	10
23-Mar-2020	it's a great app, i really like it i think that it's a good way to meet people. one problem everytime i like a video, i will scroll then go back to it and it will be unliked. i also dont like how it says "your tapping too fast take a break!" it gets annoying, overall a good app though.	11
11-Apr-2020	great app and community, but quality of video recording (whether recording in the app or externally and uploading) is absolute garbage. my phone records in 1080p and tiktok records at 420p level of quality, it's ridiculous. please improve this somehow. i have the newest note10+ and have to use my old iphone 8 to record because the quality of filming on android is murdered. it is insanely annoying, and as a growing creator, id like to be able to actually use my high def camera.	12
18-Apr-2020	very fun social media app but it is quite addicting. the only problem i found was that i am not able to send drafts of my own videos to people (i have to post them first) and i find this very annoying because some of the videos i don't want other people seeing, i just want to share them.	3
17-Apr-2020	is quite good and funny, but tiktok constantly pushes the most popular videos onto everyone, instead it should give others a chance. basically if you have a small following or just opened an account you dont get a fair chance, the ads are a disgrace. advertising videos should not be allowed to turn their comments off. it would be 5 stars if it wasnt for these issues.	8
19-Apr-2020	piece of sh** app cant even load videos correctly. spent three hours trying to gather clips together and make them work. it resets when you add or move video clips. once you're ready to upload the final video, the frame rate make it look terrible. waste of my damn time.	-3
24-Apr-2020	i've problem concern of shooting lag. i've found that just after shoot a video to post ,there is no mismatch between clip nd voiceover but after posting there is voice lag with video clip. i've found in many of my clips. nd stored clip through camera haven't lagging issue while posted clip on app have that issue. hope you understand my problem and try to fix this bug.	-8
05-Apr-2020	i would give it a higher rating, but it's frustrating to keep going thru my saved and seeing blank spaces where videos used to be but tiktok decided to delete them. ur not able to c who made the video or what it was about, so u can't go c if they remade it to like it again. plz stop deleting videos for dumb reasons. ps. and now tik tok is letting ppl use someone's nude pictures as their profile picture to troll that person. how is this a thing but u take down actual creators who use fake swords?	-4
29-Mar-2020	i joined tik tok in early jan 8 2020, decided to keep my account. i enjoy discovering all the amazing talent , (the underrated talent), but several things bother me with the app. creators of dances are not focused at top of the for you page, mostly the popular tik tokers who do the dances & many are not credited:( the biggest issue is i have is i think there is some trickery going on with the rapid number of followers being obtained as others decline or move at a slower pace or not at all.	11
31-Mar-2020	good app to post videos on, definitely a lot of fun and you can meet a lot of new cool people from around the world. very easy to go viral on tiktok, started in 2019 and managed to get a couple good videos in the millions, have been posting videos ever since and growing my page! having a great time and enjoying the daily grind of making and posting videos for my followers to see ðÿ‘ definitely an app worth giving a try if your into making videos!	20
15-Mar-2020	it keeps crashing and i tried re-downloading the app and nothing works. it stays on the title screen then after 3 seconds it crashes. i canâ´t even see the videos or anything. if you fix this in the future, i may rate 5 stars. but for now, 1 star.	0
27-Mar-2020	all day today it's been stuck on the same videos and will constantly tell me there are new ones on my following page but wont let me see them i can only see them on my for you page or by going to the account itself. i've uninstalled, logged out of my device and even restarted my phone.	-2
17-Apr-2020	no network connection. no matter what i do it just tells me no network connection and won't do anything. i clearly have network connection edit i don't know if there's a way to respond to the developer's response, but i can't even report a problem in the app	-4
19-Apr-2020	its fine, lots of dumb videos and people lack reading comprehension & plenty of bullying but that's any social media. my problem is trying to delete my account and every time i select it within manage account i get an error message saying "verification failed" and then a blank white screen... i just want to delete it ðÿ™„	-10
08-Apr-2020	it's a great app and super fun but it does have some flaws to it. there have been multiple times where i would go to open the app and not even 5 minutes of being on it and the app crashes on my phone. once the bugs get fixed,i'll give it a 5 star	8
13-Apr-2020	this app can't even work. it always says no internet when the internet is perfect. also, i can't even register, and i checked the help page and it said you need to be at least 13 to create an account, but i am over 13 and it says i'm not old enough for tiktok.	-1
18-Apr-2020	tiktok is fun!! the only thing i wish was different was the 15 sec. limit on the videos. videos need to be longer so we can sing more of the songs we like. which would also mean more time on chosen songs we would like to sing along with.	5
14-Apr-2020	see that you have contacted the app developer , i kindly request you to wait 1-3 business days for the app developer to give response. it seems like your issue is related to the app itself. the best way to resolve your issue is to contact the app developer directly. hereâ€™s how to find their contact information: visit google play select the app in question. on the app's details page, scroll down to the â€œdeveloperâ€ section . if youâ€™d like steps that typically help users with these issues see	11
14-Apr-2020	i didn't think of this app to be so good and entertaining when i first got it. in fact when i open the app most of the time i don't realize the time go by, it could be 6pm when i opened the app and next time i check the time for minimum, at least one and a half hour have passed by. overall the app is engaging, entertaining and fun especially if you're bored	11
14-Apr-2020	no doubt its really a good app... and is hope for a miracle in your life and suddenly get famous but why there is freezing of account .. watching some tiktok videos which tells your account may get freezed .due to community standards. a normal guy like me what he will do i have created another account and then i thought i have to read read community standards this time and i found i have made the mistake shoud not use two accounts so deleted that .... please help tiktok id- usernameremoved	13
18-Apr-2020	love, love this! tiktok is so not a kid thing! i'm either laughing till i cry or i'm crying because people are amazing. you don't see this kind of real inspiration on any other social media. you can kind of lean it toward what you want to watch by what you â¤. you can follow all the best ones that you like the most. i haven't done any videos yet but it is in our future!	13
19-May-2020	see, i don't do this more often but i think there are more contents which could be helpful for the youth but is missing out in this app. . indian tiktokers are basically all over the melodrama stuff trying to be super awesome but aren't. i think i don't know.. i did watch somewhat 10-12 videos and realised that they were totally sh** . sorry but i'm just being honest	6
19-Apr-2020	super apps but my video has no view. i did a lot of things i made a lot of videos i've given a lot of time you do not see us these problems. i feel bad that i don't get anything from where i spend so much time i have made many complaints but no arrangement has been made because of this, many are giving up the apps i hope you arrange it soon. my name is muhammad nafie and my account @usernameremoved thank you tiktok	-4
14-Apr-2020	i have had this app for about 4 to 5 months now and to be honest its the best app i have downloaded ever and is a great for me to escape from stressful situations and relax. this app is also great for entertainment and has a wide variety of different content for people to watch, there is literaly something for everyone on this app. i use this app the most on my phone for entertainment as i am a teenager myself but also its great to see peoples creativity being shown in a positive way.	15
25-Apr-2020	1-this app is very good, through this we get to see a lot of talent 2- through this apps people have got a stag to show their talent 3- this app is very helpful for everyone. 4- through this app we get to see and learn a lot of things 5- but i have a complaint that i have been cracking tiktok for quite some time, but tiktok is not giving views on my video, nor is the video going viral even after so much hard work.	3
22-Apr-2020	hii tiktok. i love this app and i am very active on it too. but the problem is that i don't get many views on my videos. i get 25 to 35 views on a average on my videos. even after posting the problem with tiktok team in the app my problem is not resolved. i see videos with no beauty or creativity gettiing millions of views. its shocking. and troubling too. please reslove the problem of my views to get more and more views and likes & followers. i love tiktok. plzz help me. my tiktok id prince07_	6
22-Apr-2020	tiktok is a fun app if you want to show your talent! you can also keep it private to certain people if you want! no one can control this really, but a lot of really stupid content like people jumping up and down get tons of likes, when someone who makes a masterpiece gets only 100!! but it's a cool app ðÿ˜	13
24-Mar-2020	overall i think my experience has been good...my only problem is that you cannot delete the phone number you have linked. tiktok needs to change this because they also make it so you cant have one phone number on more than one account. please fix this tiktok	-1
30-Mar-2020	it would be perfect if there was an autoplay on and off button, so i can just sit and watch rather than scroll everytime it restarts. also, if it would show the length progress to see when a vid might end. i find myself watching the same on over and over without knowing. only some will show how far in the video it is	5
05-Apr-2020	great app. but please fix the comments. they either don't show up. people don't get notified. they disappear and reappear. they don't attach to the right comment. endless! also why no option to get notified by your favourite creators?	2
19-Apr-2020	developers really need to make this app more compatible with androids. i'm missing a lot of features, like the voice over effect and the bling effect. also, the camera quality on this app is horrendous in a way that it's not on snapchat or instagram---the camera won't focus correctly, and the picture is grainy. enjoying the content though.	1
11-Apr-2020	i could rate it 5-stars but there's twoproblems first of all let me like a video when i want to like it and second of all stop putting ads on there i'm just going to scroll right past them used to not have any ads what happened to thatoh wait nevermind i was wrong there's a third problem some idiot stole my phone number so now i can't verify my phone number i can't message my friends in quarantine doesn't make it better so now i actually have to rate it 2 stars	-5
03-Apr-2020	it's so fun you can follow people lip sing, a video up to one minute long and if you don't want strangers knowing your account you can make the account private also love it. there are a lot of famous people and there's not just singing there is dancing too. i recommend this app to everyone that likes singing and dancing.	14
19-Apr-2020	my experience with tiktok has been amazing. there is a lot of cool dances and everything. the reason i give this app gour stars is because this app will sometimes glitch on me and it will log me out of my account. other than that i love this app. it is so addictive. if the app could have 5.5 stars i would give it. tiktok is great.	4
30-Mar-2020	the app is nice looking, fun to be on, interesting content, and a fun atmosphere. however, the camera is terrible on it. the image is blurry and out of focus with terrible white balance. for an app that is designed for quick content production, it missed the mark.	3
31-Mar-2020	reacts are delayed and so whatever you do will be a second late. when you record with audio i try won't record any other sound...? super frustrating since it will record your sound and you can mix it with sound you choose. so no karaoke. you also cant upload you music	2
04-Apr-2020	i love this app it really helps me when im board lol. however last time i had tiktok iy would not let me type i don't know why. and i can't follow people. i will try again and see if ot workes. i also could not post videoes and i had to keep them in my drafts and that is just taking up my spase on the phone. please and think you. hope yall a good day	11
10-Apr-2020	hey tiktok team, thanks for your good team work which connects people worldwidely, but i have to suggest one intresting thing to you on which i hope you are already working on it, and the thing is that to add playlist option like a "youtube"app. because with the help of playlist option in tiktok,the user can put their most likely videos by creating different kind of playlist by their choice, it will not hard to find different kind of videos . so please provide such a customize play list option.	13
01-Apr-2020	i love tik tok but due to certain situations and content that i've been seeing recently its come to my attention that this app doesnt seem to be all that safe. i feel as thought alot of the content is inappropriate with content that is either overly violent ( abuse, blood ect) or overly sexual ( minors dancing inappropriately). they are also banning people speaking out about. predatory behavior? this app was meant to be safe and creative. please listen to people and dont ban them...	-3
23-Apr-2020	its amazing! i saw a comment that said he cant get more views, but its not just for the views. its about having fun! you don't have to be famous to have fun, thats like saying you need a pool too have fun outside. anyways, the app is really fun. im only 11, so if my grammar is 'flawless'.	20
10-Apr-2020	profile pics finally saved but also noticed i have to keep replaying videos and it never reaches the end of them, just buffers and i never see the whole vid. there is an update every other 2 days and its very annoying. otherwise addictive and better than facebook for entertainment.	5
13-Apr-2020	i can't even sign up for tiktok. using facebook, google or even my email it doesn't work. i manage to get in with my phone number but once in the app nothing comes up. no videos, i can't even upload a profile picture. can someone help to solve this problem please.	-1
06-Apr-2020	it's really fun honestly . i don't make content but getting to watch other people's content is awesome .the only problem i have isn't with the app but with tha users. there is a lot of hate towards you once you start creating content and parsons make fun of other parson for there like. looks etc.other then that this is an interesting amazing app.	13
21-Apr-2020	i love this app and all of the dances on it, the only thing is, whenever i try and comment on someone's post it doesnt go through even if i do it on a different accountðÿ˜£ also, it wont let me use the same phone number twice and i have had a few accounts since i always forget the password when i get a new phone, so i cant text anyone one it. please fix these tik tok xx	3
25-Apr-2020	i really love this app but videos are getting viral and they are not going on for you page as my followers are also getting decreased and views on video are not coming anymore 30 to 50 views are coming. because of this reason my interest in this app is decreasing and i am not posting videos. please try solve my this problem as my account has gone freeze. my id is @usernameremoved.	4
20-Apr-2020	hiiiiii i love this app. but the problem is that i don't get many views, like and followers my videos.i get 25 to 40 views on an average on my video's even after. i see videos with no better, no beauty or creativity but he's getting millions of views, like n following.its shocked.plz solve the problem i m so ðÿ¤”ðÿ¤”ðÿ¤”ðÿ™ƒðÿ™ƒ. i love tik tok. plz help. thanks	8
17-Apr-2020	don't get me wrong but the app it is good but it needs some work it is not good for the app if it doesn't let all images because my little cousin try to get on this they said she couldn't get on the app because it's not for kids that's underneath well you see i think they should allow all ages butthey don't because the people the teams on the app are not straight so list it wouldn't let me see some real quick if you're going to have tens on this app in your phone and the tens are not good	4
11-Apr-2020	i've already tried setting up 2 accounts because the first one started giving me issues. now the second one is. and customer support wont get back to me. everything starts out fine. then i start getting network connection errors. its deiving me crazy!	2
15-Apr-2020	i only gave it a 4 because i have to do a lot of updates on it, but this is also a very good app and also sometimes it wouldn't let me edit things, but i saved it to my drafts and i got it perfectly to work but sometimes it would lag and it would delete the video i just made with, sometimes it will be good and sometimes it will be bad, but those are just my friends, but in reality, it's a really good app. and i also do suggested and there are also very fun creators.	17
01-Apr-2020	pretty good however saved drafts can have some audio issues. mainly when the audio clip used is not at the beginning of a much longer audio and it reverts to having the audio start from the beginning. there is no way to rectify this unless you post the tiktok, download it and reupload after finding the audio and the correct place.	3
21-Apr-2020	hello tik tok this app and i am every time active on it too. but the problem is that i don't get many views on my every videos. i get 25 to 39 views on average on my videos. even after posting the problem with tik tok team in the app my problem is not resolved. it's shocking. i m a artistst. can you see my videos. plz unfreeze my account request thanks tiktok my id @usernameremoved	-3
23-Mar-2020	this app is amazing,i can do lots of thing for example i can "heart" so many posts that i like,but the reason i gave it 4 stars is because when i type my phone number so u can verify,it says the phone number is used,so i can't text my friends,please fix this issue, thank you for your time.	2
05-Apr-2020	it's very entertaining, although trying to make it in the "for you page" as a small account is very difficult because most famous tiktokers have already a boost because of their musically, youtube or instagram. i just recommend more smaller creators to get recognized by their amazing talents. also tiktok has a hard time verifying creators for example "thexhan", she has 4.8 million followers, but she's still not verified and tiktok verified "jameswright" when he had 500k.	7
28-Mar-2020	i love this app, and yet very addictive, but i only rate 4 stars because i have multiple google accounts, and when making a new tik tok account (google account of course) i cant choose a different account so then i have to reinstall the app, yet very fun and addictive, would recommend when bored !	7
13-Apr-2020	please move the not interested button, i keep hitting it when i'm trying to favorite a tik tok. or at least have it pop up and say "are you sure?" it's very annoying, i wish i could undo it, i've accidentally said i'm not interested in some of my favorite tik toks.	10
12-Apr-2020	i like it a lot the only problem is i can't message my friends unless they are following me you need to fix that tik tok please. still need you to make it to where there is a request for messages, so if i try to message my friends that don't follow me during quarantine, they at least know i'm trying to message them kinda like instagram does it, you know? please please please ðÿ™ðÿ™ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­	9
04-Apr-2020	it's cool! i use it everyday.although i'm not famous on the app, it's still fun to follow trends and post jokes and stuff. the privacy settings are good and you can also go live if you have over 1000 followers. you can also text or send a video to someone that follows you and you follow that person back.the only thing i don't like about it is that there is alot if cussing and bad words in it, which makes mom look at me in a strange way whenever a bad word comes up.all in all, it's a great appðÿ‘	9
17-Apr-2020	don't get me wrong about this app it's a really a good app but every time that i'm just rolling across my phone i see the word you have a notification from tik tok and then i log into to tik tok the see what that notification was and there's nothing there like you need to fix that because it's really annoying please.ðÿ˜	1
18-Apr-2020	this app is awsome and i enjoy watching videos by different creators.....but i'm facing i problem, i'm having 12 followers but in my id its showing only 7. i'm feeling very bad about this. but if i keep this problem apart then it's a very cool app having all the stuff i want.ðÿ˜š	-3
26-Apr-2020	i am so confused, how i could know about this app so late. it's so unique, so amazing and so fun. social network for make people smile. thank you so much for giving us this chance to realize our talents and share our emotions with millions people all over the world. this app absolutely for everyone. people can find their oun topic and live in this world. i remember the day when i just sat on the sofa and felt so boring, when i found the video about tiktok. since that day world totally changed	9
28-Apr-2020	i really love this app but videos are getting viral and they are not going on for you page as my followers are also getting decreased and views on video are not coming anymore 30 to 50 views are coming. because of this reason my interest in this app is decreasing and i am not posting videos. please try to solve my problem as my account has gone freeze. my id is usernameremoved .tik tok account has become freeze, unfreeze him.thank him,	4
23-Apr-2020	hi... i love this app and i am very active on it too but the problem is that i don't get many views my videos i get 25 to 40 views on average on my videos even after posting the problem with tik tok team in the app my problem is not resolved. i see videos with no beauty or creativity getting millions of views. it's shocking and troubling too. please resolve the problem. i love tik tok and want more views my videos please. please please... my tik tok id @usernameremoved my gmail id usernameremoved	5
13-Apr-2020	dear tik tok, you have been a very good app to most people. but i remember this app as a funny, comedic app. not an app where only "pretty people" are allowed. i remember a time where tik tok was all about laughs not popularity, now it's all about popularity. and it makes me really sad to see this app. i want comedy not half naked people standing in front of their phones doing nothing. please change i want the old tik tok back.	6
01-Apr-2020	this app is fun but it can get pretty buggy at times. also people you've blocked can still interact with your stuff without your knowledge, and will still show up in your feed if people you follow duet them. they also tend to shadowban cosplayers and people that are lgbtq+	4
23-Apr-2020	this app is helpful for improve hidden talent.. but most of the people who have talent but video is not viral in fact they all are try to do more best.. if a popular creater stand only in his /her video he got more like and also video viral... but small user 's video not viral they want to improve our talent	18
26-Mar-2020	tik tok is a really good app you can make videos from comedy to your own sound. if you are scared of random people seeing your videos make your account private and you can now text on the app with your friends. the one thing i wish to happen is to be able to message people who aren't following you like the "famous" tik tokers	5
26-Apr-2020	ok so its a cool app no glitches or any thing like that but im not really happy i can't go live on it because i don't have 1000 fans but it a good app and i do enjoy it. also i like how theres not that many adds. but you do have to pay for tiktok coins things so i want to send someone a gift when they go live i would have to pay for it which i dont want to do.	12
12-Apr-2020	tiktok i love your app so much but the thing i hate about it is that when i tried to get my sec account back it didn't work even when i put my code in. it said "verification failed please click resend and try again" but i do love your app but can you not put "codes" anymore. can we just put our number/email in and we can get our 2nd/3rd account plsss	2
17-Mar-2020	amazing this app makes my day every day i always have something to look forward to. on this app i laugh smile and can chat with my friends! my favorite part is to see all the different things people see and do. i soon hope that everyone will we the wonders in tik tok. i also enjoy learning new thing like fun facts or new dances and also mabey even meet new people. people can really get a good experience forms this app. this can really get addicting but at the end of the day your glad you did it.	21
28-Mar-2020	i do love tiktok but two of my accounts have disappeared and i now cannot go onto them since i forgot the password. idk why they disappeared too because i went and clicked on one and it said something went wrong and disappeared. i reset my phone but still nothing...i didn't use my email or phone number for them cause like i thought it would be okay but its really upsetting since i have new friends that now i cannot contact :( help :(	-5
15-Apr-2020	i can't get view in my video. i have 242 followers. but now till i only get few viewers (2/3 in some video). previously this problem was not there. but now few days it happens... follower not increasing, likes not get, viewer not get.. pls solve it. otherwise i will stop using tiktok and uninstall it.... account name usernameremoved	0
09-Apr-2020	this app is soo fun you can make videos and you can watch other people's videos!! the bad thing is that there are a lot of bully's on here soo watch out! if you want to just watch videos and not make any you have to make an account but if you don't want to upload any videos you dont!! well anyway have a great time on tik tok and be safe!!	6
07-Apr-2020	it is ok but the problem is that it would say that someone like my video or something but then there would not be a thing. can you please fix it. but it is a good app, good way to help with people's self confidence. it is just the bug that got it 2 starts and i can't make videos as well. thank you ðÿ‘ðÿ‘žðÿ‘ðÿ‘ž	11
04-Apr-2020	it's so laggy and it takes up so much storage due to its junk files piling up over time and it makes my phone hot as heck and there is not any way i can just take photos and instead i have to make a video and turn it into a jpg file and that is such a pain in the nutcrackers bro and it has bad filters and i am even suprised people even use it plus the videos that people make are not even funny most of the time but not all the time and sometimes tik tok won't let you upload wich is annoying	-1
14-Apr-2020	tik tok recently added a feature to reply to comments with a video, which doesn't sound that bad in theory, right? wrong. every single person who likes a comment gets a notification when someone replies to the comment with a video, which is absurd. imagine liking a comment on instagram or youtube to show your support, and every single time that comment is replied to, you get a notification as well. i hate it. i'll change this to 5 stars when they fix it.	1
11-Apr-2020	i love this app! tiktok is the best way for me to be occupied anywhere and at anytime. i love the content that is shown their and i love how you can make your own videos and content too! best of all, this app lets you follow, like, and comment on any video and person. all you have to do is sign in.	15
19-Apr-2020	it is good and all but i would really like that there wasn't a following limit thats the thingo that shows how many people i'm following there's a limit for some stupid reason and the limit is 10k it is much but why is there even a limit?? bc i would want that number to go up even more bc it just makes me more happy my acc is: maltazaras so yeah that's stupid that there's some limit	12
19-Apr-2020	for past few days i can't able access my tik tok... it's just loading loading loading ... help me ..there is no network issue.... if i reinstall the app... videos are available for one day... but after that it's not working.	0
23-Mar-2020	i wanted to give you 5 out of 5 stars but couldn't pay for a reason. i have a complaint against your application. i think the terms and conditions regarding your video upload need to be changed. various life-threatening videos that are uploaded to your app. i think those videos should be completely deleted from your app. or the user's account should be locked.	-3
15-Apr-2020	i love making videos on this app... but now they are not giving views to the videos... earlier i received 20 views 30 views and if i am lucky then 100 but now i get 0 views i don't get why... i use trending hashtags and do every required thing still getting 0 views from a week.... my id is ( @usernameremoved) also i have tried reaching several times to tiktok via app report a problem option.... if u can't help me grow so atleast do not stop... fix this tiktok	7
14-Apr-2020	this app is pretty cool and pretty okay foot thing is most people won't be able to see your videos and less tick-tock decides to put them on the for you page which makes it really hard to enjoy the app otherwise you're just making videos for yourself and also they only let you have about 20 words when you're writing a comment which is kind of bad because some people are trying to ask you put out a statement in the comments and you're not allowed to have more than 20 or 21 words which sucks	1
21-Mar-2020	very fun cool app. on my other account though people try and save my videos but say they cant. when i try to make it where you can, no matter how hard i try, i click off and on and it still wont let them save it!!! please help me fix this problem	11
26-Mar-2020	i recently downloaded this app (tik tok) on my phone today for the first time and it..... it will not open. it's freezing and laggy and i couldn't make an account because it is laggy, like extremely laggy. it's the only app that is lagging and freezing on my phone.	0
21-Mar-2020	i love the creative and funny content that comes out of this app. it's good way for people to express themselves, their ideas, and their creativity. i really enjoy being on tik tok, although it takes up a lot of storage space after awhile.	14
31-Mar-2020	it is such a fun app that has evolved through so many changes. i have been using this since the very start of its existance as musically. i reccoment this to anyone who enjoyed vine and want the same energy back from something new and fresh. plus u can see all your favorite celebraties take on challenges including gordon ramsey and the rock.	9
23-Mar-2020	it's a really good app , the only thing is that some filters dont work on some phones and i have reported the problem 3 days ago but no one is getting back to me , since the app is so popular most of your videos dont get seen by people, but that's ok it's no ones fault. tiktok is just a popular app	5
09-Apr-2020	honestly i think this is a great app really no problems it works smoothly and the ads aren't a problem and it is a very creative platform in general so it is a 5 star from me. the only thing that kind of annoys me is the fact that it like blocks you and the texting is also kind of annoying but no other problems	-5
19-Apr-2020	hello tiktok, i have post many videos but they dont get like more than 50 and views 500. this is the problem facing everytime. video stuck in the time and spread much as i thought. please resolve it. at least dont give fake views and likes to everyone.	0
26-Mar-2020	one one time tik tok won't work properly. most of the time the effects won't work. i would like to say some positive points about tik tok. it is helpful for more birthday wishes, songs, for festivals, we can do more comedys in this, we can use templates, we can do status maker, we can put for status any others tik tok, it's very interesting app. thank u who had created this app. thank u. we can put for status.. one second thanks	14
06-Apr-2020	it has the potential to be a great app, but instead it's hyper sensative, has unclear guidlines, & bans popular crearors instead of supporting them. that's not even mentioning the horrible treatment of lgbt people, artists, & cosplayers (aka the people who really keep the app alive).	3
05-May-2020	this is a super fun app. but im gonna rate it a 3 because when i want to use effects, it tells me system version out of date. i have updated my phone and all but it still stays the same. but it is a wonderful app with many sounds and cool dances that you can do. i would recommend it as a must download app	15
28-Mar-2020	i love this app! there is just one problem though. for some reason, about 3/4 of the tiktok i watch won't allow me to finish them. like, the last 5-3 ish seconds just won't load. idk if this happens for other people, or just for me, but it's really annoying.	2
20-Apr-2020	the one problem i have with this app is the outward camera quality for the android. i try and make tiktoks with my samsung 9 but the outward camera quality makes it difficult to make good tiktoks. i see this as a common problem for all android users who have a decently new samsung phone. please fix this issue as soon as you can.	3
20-Apr-2020	i love scrolling mindlessly through videos. and then i decided to duet a video, unfortunately no matter what i did the original video sound and my sound did not line up. i tried clearing the cache, uninstalling/reinstalling, restarting my phone. but no fix had happened.	1
05-Apr-2020	i do about 5 tiktoks a day because the app is so awesome it is great dlfor people who love dancing and singing but if you do not like people taking parts of songs and not using the whole this game is not for you also it is not an offline app so you need mobile data internet outside or wi-fi also i love this app but there is an issue it won't let me on the for you page and i have been trying for months i want it to so bad please read this tik tok my account is @usernameremoved please let me	14
08-Apr-2020	it does what it says it'll do. can be used for good, bad, other. the more you like some subject it custom tailors it to you. my personal feed is inspirational and a love for our healthcare workers and police and military. it's honestly been an uplifting app through this quarantine!	9
22-Apr-2020	my account has been freezed and no views r there. after posting so many videos also there is no response . people doing nothing gets millions likes . i just don't get more than 50 to 100 views even after being active . i've tried many things but my account is still freezed . i request u to solve the problem. my id :@usernameremoved	1
15-Apr-2020	love this app it is the king of videos it will keep updating there is nothing wrong with it there are settings for you to personalize to your experience if you are looking at this dowload if not already.ðÿ¤© if you are concerned about your privacy then just make a private account. you can have up to 3 accounts on 1 device. ðÿ˜ have fun	-4
20-Apr-2020	this app is overall great but there are some features that you are not able to use with my type of phone for example green screen and the voiceover effect i'm only aware of these things because i do see them on my other friends phones and they have iphones. also i heard something about the android quality looking bad because the apps weren't weren't accustoming to the android type file. if there's any way that the manufacturers could fix that that would be great.	5
25-Apr-2020	i have worst experience with this app...you are deleting my videos without any reason...saying that it violates community guide lines..i haven't got any clear explanation what is wrong with my videos. .am requesting you to verify it and i need my videos back... (_un_available__) this is my username..please give my video back.	-6
23-Mar-2020	i am trying to do a slideshow and it will not let me: 1. do slideshow with no sound 2. would not even let me pick another song apart from the compulsory two choices thst tiktok put. there is no option to even upgrade to a premium version so i can select my choices!! help??	1
01-Apr-2020	the video is great and there one little problem it kinda waste my storage and i don't really have enough storage. i'm being honest. the thing i like tik tok is the funny one and my favorite one is drawing anything :3.	8
05-Apr-2020	this app is great just like instagram but more appropriate for kids you can also start and end 'trends' and also learn the dances which gives so much more energy i definitely recommend it but i gave a 4 star because i use it almost all the time but you need wi fi so i cant use it most of the time.	9
12-Apr-2020	it is just addicting. you can post 15 to 60 second videos with different sounds or you can choose to just view the videos. either way, tiktok is amazing. these are my literal thoughts of the app so like believe me lol. overall i find tiktok an interesting app for me on all my devices. yes you will most likely find bugs but most of the time they are with dms with other people (but like i don't usually use the weird messaging part)	7
18-Apr-2020	when people share videos with me the links rarely ever open right. it'll load something totally random. takes several tries of clicking the link to open the right one. submitted a ticket weeks ago and no one acknowledged. your app for android sucks. fix it.	-1
15-Apr-2020	love it, but please take away the feature of replying to comments with a video. i got 30 notifcations in the span of 4 hours just from people replying to random comment i liked at some point. it's very annoying, please fix it.	4
16-Apr-2020	i like the app, but i hate when it says "you're tapping too fast.take a break!" i hate that. i can take a break when my fingers hurt. you don't know when my fingers start hurting. please remove that feature. otherwise the app is great. p.s. i have nothing against the app just saying that i dont like that feature	-5
18-Apr-2020	recently i have been getting some problems with tiktok. whenever i upload videos, it shows that it had been viewed by hundreds of people within few hours, but later wen i check that again i usually find that it has been viewed by only a few.. approx 30.. why does it happen ?? plz expalin tiktok. need some logical and genuine answers	4
08-Apr-2020	i really can't explain. it's so fun!! me and my friend tell everyone to download the app. if you know what likee is, this is a better version. tiktok make good songs and videos. likee takes all the videos and song a cuts them shorter. just get tiktok!!!! what r u waiting for?????	20
22-Mar-2020	worked great at first. i would send videos to my friend via facebook messenger. now it won't let me send any videos that way and it's very frustrating. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still won't work.	4
15-Apr-2020	i am only exploring tiktok now. as i wanted to get a feel for what tiktok is about and feeling out the bugs. there seems to be quite a few upload content disappearing or whole accounts get ripped out i'm assuming by tiktok it self. i've even heard one person losing 7 accounts. i myself havent posted anything just yet. as i said i'm exploring right now. but it's all around wholesome fun so far. minus those bugs.	2
11-Apr-2020	i really like this app. but for some reason; this app won't let me use the green screen feature every time i want to use it on my tiktoks it says "sorry, this feature is not available for your device". i use an android, is that why? and if so, can someone please fix it	7
10-Apr-2020	this app is one of the best ways to pass time quickly, i think it is amazing, you can also post videos of your own with your own creative mind. it can become addicting, i am on here 24/7. i haven't seen any problem with this app so far, and i've had it for years!!! so i recommend getting it uwu	5
12-Apr-2020	during this lock down this has been one of the best apps i have downloaded in a long time .. the videos that people do are just hilarious and i can be nosing for a good 2 hours at times and not even realise it :) go on give it a go ;) lol .. defo recommend for this difficult time for sure.	16
20-Apr-2020	i'm trying to login into tiktok and it says that you don't have wifi connection even though that i have wifi . before the update tiktok was entertaining but not it's really disappointing. (it doesn't even works when i want to send my feedback it keeps saying the same thing)	3
23-Apr-2020	dear tik tok, i have been using the tik tok app for a long time. but i am facing a problem, i am not getting the option of live on my tik tok id. i have done this complaint to you very often but there is no response from your side. my followers are in lakhs who want to see me live please. i hope you solve my problem very soon.	-4

14-Apr-2020	it is a very good app and i do recommend but if you delete it or get a new phone your drafts will be lost and this happened to me so if you do delete it or get a new phone post all your drafts and put them under only my view so then you still have them!ðÿ˜š	2
25-Mar-2020	i absolutely love this app. whenever i am having a bad day i just open ut up and within seconds i'm laughing and my day is completly better. plus its also brpught me out of my shell and i make videos. mostly due to being in the house alot do to the pandemic with covid-19 going on.	1
01-Apr-2020	its a cool app i just wish that i could actually get tiktok rewards bc i have 2000 points and i cant spend any of them it always says reward not available and if you dont know what im talking about go to your tik tok page (the far left option in the bottom) and in the top left there is a blue star and there you can earn points to get rewards but i can never redeem any rewards	12
13-Apr-2020	at first i thought i would never enjoy tiktok. i downloaded it 3 times before, and uninstalled it. 4th time i downloaded it offered me to choose whitch genre i like, and i love this feature! i really enjoy tiktok, on the internet it has the reputation of the "new vine" but for me, it's way better! i enjoy it, and just like youtube... i have an addiction (healthy btw)	13
13-Apr-2020	awesome app ðÿ‘œ i'm new to it but love it have been posting funny videos and i'm amazed by the numbers of like and followers in a just 2 weeks. i did not know i could entertain haha ðÿ˜… and guess what my audience are children following me hmmmm how did they know i'm a teacher they love what i post, looking forward to doing educational videos .	17
14-Apr-2020	nice app for improve your inner artist and with show your emotions by editing, acting with team. do use hashtags and lighting removes the video clear before uploading. you can earn money and make more money by your interesting videos, but videos may be informational messages. give health tips, give some recipes, give some coaching classes with this app. whatever the things in which you are perfect, may make videos and upload videos. thanks to this app for utilizing time in this lockdown.	7
21-Apr-2020	now in this new update we can not open our draft videos without internet.. previous update was good even in this update there was a trouble in finding a song... and pls make that the draft videos can be played without internet so at least when doesn't have net we can do our timepass	1
26-Mar-2020	love this app. but i recently got a new phone and idk if its the phone i use but i no longer have the ability to use the filters when making a video. i don't see an update thing so i was wondering if you guys could fix that or is it just cuz of my phone?	4
18-Apr-2020	only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is the inability to remove the captions that cover the videos. seriously, a simple button in the corner or something would be nice.	-2
22-Apr-2020	i love the app so far its the best u can like and make ur own videos. and the special effects are amazing buuuuuuut what happened was dat when i tried liking a video or commenting and scroll up to another video it tells me couldn't like video or couldn't post commet. but i'm in the middle of updating it hopefully it won't perform whatever i just listed above. the app is great though i really like it. ðÿ‘	23
23-Apr-2020	hi... i love this app i am very active on it too.. but the problem is that i don't get many views on my videos... i got 25 to 50 views on an average on my videos.. even after posting the problem with tiktok team in the app my problem ia not resolved... i see videos with no beauty or creativity getting million of views.its shocking, and troubleling too.. please resolve the problem. i love tiktok and want more views on my videos. please please i request you help me. my id is maanugoyal32	10
30-Mar-2020	the app is ok but ever since i've done the past few updates everytime i go and watch a video and before the video finishes it plays up before it even ends. the app was perfectly fine up until now and it gets annoying. it never use to do this untill i updated it.	5
17-Apr-2020	the not interested button used to not be there when you would hold down on a video, it would just be add to favorites and save video, now i keep hitting not interested on videos i want to add to favorites and messing up my tiktok algorithm...	9
16-Apr-2020	tiktok is a great app but i live in iran and after 3 minutes that i download this app it says no network connection but i,m online and i connect to vpn but it don,t work .the most of people that they live in iran have this problem too . what we should do to repair this ? please check it .	4
11-Apr-2020	tik tok is a great app and can allow people to add costome things to there videos.like if you wanted to turn off coments it would alow you to. the app is super easy to use. i love this app. everyday it makes my day. the app has all sorts of fun video that everyone will love. i recomend this app a lot.it gives me a good old laugh when ever i open tik tok.	22
28-Mar-2020	i absolutely love tik tok! it's informative, hilarious, and i've met some really good folks on here! the videos are great, the people are amazing, everyone is doing different things and there are yummy video recipes too! a little bit of everything! plus, it helps th o pass t j.g e time during this covid-19 quarantine lol! ðÿ˜ðÿ˜ðÿ˜	11
17-Apr-2020	i love it really much! the only thing i hate about it is that you can only put maximum of 100 char. on comments and 80 in the caption but it does make my day, the trend that actually makes my day is the misheard lyrics and its really funny! there is lots more you need to know by downloading this!	0
20-Apr-2020	i only downloaded it to tell you the ads are annoying. especially that guy with glasses that looks stupid, i'm playing loud music on treadmill and he goes on about pants like what the heck is wrong with him.	0
30-Mar-2020	really good and fun. if it worries it's like insta or yt it's not really when it comes to privacy. u can make ur vids so only u can see them. there is swearing but no sexual or nude content. u can make ur account private so only ur friends can see them. friends are followers that u have followed back. they can request a follow if u know them and u can accept it so they can see ur vids(this is only i'd ur acc is on private) if u want to be famous set ur vids free in public mode. hit1k go live	2
02-Apr-2020	it's really fun! i would definitly recommend it. just be aware that not all people are family friendly. so don't let kids under 13 or 14 be on this app. just for their saftey, please. there are a lot of people to follow like gamers, furries, cosplayers, vloggers, lgbtq+ and way more! there are people who are a mix. here's an example: they can be a gamer, a furry and a cosplayer while being part of lgbtq+, or they are suppoters! you can also lipsync to your favorite audio or music! it's fun! ðÿ˜š	6
10-Apr-2020	my son and his 2 brothers recently started using this and it's not good for kids under the age of 40.. this app alo trys to fool parents with phone monitering by listing the app under "musically" not "tic tok" if you want to investigate, newer app and already had to be in child law court and still declares it's "rare" for predators or sexual content to be found? just the way this app builder conducts themselves is shady as h3ll. my son won't be learning bad singing here .. dueces	-3
26-Mar-2020	this app brings me so much joy!! there are so many talented, caring, funny, and wonderful people in this world! i love the diversity of the various posts, including age. my 2 year old has learned lots of dances and knows just how to find the app on my phone!! you do have to monitor minors because there are some posts that tend to be a little raunchy, but for the most part they are reasonable. you will love it, i don't regret it. i sometimes have to force myself to put it down. ðÿ˜	8
30-Mar-2020	my experience with tiktok has been amazing. there is a lot of cool dances and everything. the reason i give this app gour stars is because this app will sometimes glitch on me and it will log me out of my account. other than that i love this app. it is so addictive. if the app could have 4.5 stars i would give it. tiktok is great.	4
16-Apr-2020	fun app but its not optimized for android at all. there is no adjust clip option which is really frustrating. i put multiple tickets in but haven't had any response. overall, it seems to run smoother and take less shaky videos on ios. super addicting with good content though!	2
03-Apr-2020	i personally really enjoy this app a lot i love making videos on this app but i am really disappointed in the green screen filter i hav a google phone and this filter isn't supported for my device that's why i give it 4 stars i would have given it 5 stars but it's just because of the filter.	5
03-Apr-2020	since 18 february, it has been broken. it says there's no connection when i'm obviously connected to wifi. even if i deleted it and instal it again it doesn't work. it has been like that for me and my friend since then. please do something about it.	3
20-Apr-2020	it is probably the best ever app ever! there is so much things to do on the app. i rated the 4 stars because the sound says it is not in your country its quite annoying that you cant here the audio. my second thing is if you want green screen sometimes (dosent work for me) it would say like it won't work or probably just the type of device i use please try fix it maybe bit overall it is the best app in have discovere.	8
18-Apr-2020	i absolutely love this app but i would just like for effects like the green screen ect. to be for all phones not just iphones and i think we should be able to go live at every follower count not just 1000 or more i hope you have a good day and i hope your safe	14
16-Apr-2020	i love this app, interacte with others, have fun, express yourself!! i would rate it a 5 star, but the reason i rated it a 4 star is because it is really addicting, and i spend litterally half my life on it, but other than that, amazing app, great security!!	10
25-Apr-2020	hiii i like this app but i have a prblm my videos did not get views more than 25-50 views ,i saw many videos that did not have any thing special but that type of video get millions of views this make me disappointed ,i love to make video on tiktok and i want to make much more but that type of thing make me disappointed so please solve my prblm plz plz plz plz thank u	2
24-Apr-2020	nice app but not able to put my own sounds from my mobile. im not able to make a video of my wish . the dialogue which i need is not there in this and i am not able to upload from my mobile also pchh!!!! other than this the app is marvaless	1
22-Apr-2020	app is good but no chance for new users to get viral the video or fame . only the famous people videos are showing is every account but when a new user make a video and upload it there is no more than 10 to 20 views.the developer should fix problem to make app like that also a chance to viral a new user because in tiktok not the audience just watch the videos they also make there own videos	7
26-Apr-2020	so, as far as this tik tok app is concerned it's excellent and entertaining app.but the problem i'm facing now is irritating, i think my account is freezed or something else, because max 20-30 views are coming , even on decent videos. i request you to fix this issue. please ðÿ™.	2
15-Apr-2020	used to be a decent app. now it's full of underage girls flashing their nude photos or twerking in skimpy clothing. i feel the people that run tiktok could be way better without all the young girls trying to get famous any way they can. its ridiculous that i see good quality videos that get taken down for no reason, but yet these 15 year old girls can get on here half naked and twerking and it stays up. there are grown men hitting on these young girls in this app and you are not doing anything.	3
04-Apr-2020	this app is amazing as it is the way to show your own hidden talent. even u can see your own celebrity crush , when they r live or at any celibrity face shoew. and the main is that u can get some income source from this app. awsm. i really liked it a lot. u can make your own videos at your own choice. i am using it for 4 years but actually some tine our video doesnt go so viral. actually there is trick to make viral videos but by doing this u can make at your own risk the accout may be blocked	3
30-Mar-2020	i love this app, i have this up since 2019. people if you like showing stuff to the world, this app is for you. i love showing the world my art. at first i saw it dumb but now i see it like a job. it has some negativity but the other 99.99 percent it's positive. i love it and i hope it never shuts down.	10
17-Apr-2020	it's a really great app i knew it from my friend she told me about the great experience that she had in this app 1.you can post videos that everyone can see it or if you don't want you can make it private 2.you can see others great videos 3.you would know some challenges in the app. 4. you can like the videos that you loved and don't worry because no one at least you can see it.	11
12-Apr-2020	hi , whenever i lunch tiktok, it says no network connection, can someone help me ? the app was running fine a while ago but now i can't do anything even logging in my account and i have tried uninstalling and cleaning cache and etc. but it doesn't work. my phone: galaxy note 10 plus running android 10	4
06-Apr-2020	it's a great app, but i don't get why do you only recommend videos to people near you or in your country.it limits the user's possibillity to grow and some users such as me may want to target a different audience or a demografic.i sincerly hope that u will change that alghoritam because i've heard too many people complaining inluding myself.	5
16-Mar-2020	i love this app but to be honest i dont think it is all too great. it takes down amazing videos and makes people insecure. they put boys with their shirts off on the for you page and amazing people with artistic talent not on the for you page. this app needs to get it together	15
22-Apr-2020	whether you love or hate the content of the community, this review is supposed to be for the actual product, which is very well-designed in my opinion. i like being able to use and search tags, there's good discoverability in the for you tab, and is all-around a well-formatted app. not much i can really find to dislike.	7
17-Apr-2020	seeing some beautiful creative videos concepts make me happy all the times in that tiktok is the best one. too many creative people out there but some things stop some people from letting out their creativity by some basic things in this app so tiktok app developer should do some more user friendly things in it. here are some vulgar content and things are there and the app shouldn't allow such things. and iam very happy useing this tiktok app thank you so much for that	20
02-Apr-2020	tik tok is a super fun app to be on. i love it. but hopefully tik tok fixes this one problem of mine. the problem is that i wish they would make all effects avaliable for all devices. i dont see why my device cant use the green screen effect, it makes me mad. at least make greenscreen available for all devices pleaaaase	9
19-Mar-2020	it's been a right app for me for now for a few years when i get a new phone i will always download the app i love using it it's great for entertaining and if you have a problem there are quick to help and are great customers care i love the app and you will love it too so dont think about it just download	19
17-Apr-2020	i really think it's a five star app, the reason i gave it only three was because you need a thousand followers to go live, and i just think it's really unfair because small creators need it way more than the big creators do, i have my own account and almost have 200 followers and i really want to go with live but i can't because of this unfair rule. so maybe you guys could consider the thousands of small creators that really want to go live it would be â­â­â­â­â­.	-1
10-Apr-2020	hello tiktok team, im having trouble with the double exposure section everytime when i want to make a new video in it...it is always saying me to download it..this has been a serious issue please fix this as soon as possible...	0

18-Apr-2020	used to be excellent but now i am facing an issue. when i make video the tiktok logo doesn't appear on video. in the previous versions there used to be tiktok logo and id address on video. i have reported this issue so many times in tiktok but no response. ðÿ˜ðÿ˜	1
10-Apr-2020	sure i love it but, i think there was an update recently and there's this "not interested" button right under the "favorite" button and it has been causing a lot of headaches. other than that it's good.	3
17-Apr-2020	i tried to become a tiktok tester and it said there were to many people and couldn't accept anymore people but my friends said there was still space. and i keep trying but it says it's full when it's not. so may you please add some more slots for a few more people.:)thanks	4
26-Mar-2020	even tho it's my second day...ugh....i uploaded a video and .....0 views, 0 comments, 0 likes....nada. nothing. i'm just wondering if this is some sort of bug? because i've already reupload an original video and for no reason there's literally no activity. if this is some sort of bot going around marking videos i understand...but....i'm pretty certain not every video is stolen. there is stolen videos. but i'm a little bit disappointed.	-3
20-Apr-2020	no security for account.all the videos and draft videos are deleted automatically.the old version is better. in that version we are getting more likes and our videos seen by more people. this version helps to only popular creators.	7
31-Mar-2020	i love tik tok. you can just scroll past ads, like and comment on videos, and follow people so whenever you follow somebody, you get a notification on when they post! but just one suggestion, whenever you are making a tik tok and use the timer can you add a 5 second because it's with a 3 or 10 second timer? add that and you get your 5th starâ­ðÿœÿ	8
19-Apr-2020	i am happy with this app in dear tik tok, but not as much as i want because my app is not growing on this app, nor are i getting more likes nor my live option is running while my follower is 1.5 have been and like 5000, so i am not so satisfied with this app as i want	14
14-Apr-2020	i love tiktok and i've had it since it was musical.ly, but i've seen that other people have dark mode on their tiktok, and i wanted to put it on mine, but it was not there. i googled how to do it and it said that not all tiktokers can have tiktok on dark mode because some were on a test to see if they would add it globally, but that if you had dark mode on your phone, that tik tok would automatically put it. i have dark mode in my phone and tiktok did not put it, so it's kind of disappointing.	3
19-Apr-2020	i liked it when it was music.ly but tiktok this is a whole different story sit back you reading this.i used to love this back in 2017 but ever since it became tiktok i haven't scrached a single view without haveing tk like my own video if i don't no one sees it and i don't like liking my videos.than there are them people that hate on anything me myself being cosplayer/weeb/furry/gamer girl alot of that becomes bullied on here and it kind gets bad showing up on the for you page no just no fix it.	2
16-Apr-2020	hi this is very entertaining and enjoyable app , no doubt its most treanding of all time famous short video app but for me as a video creator , i regularly posts vidios but i am not getting encouraging feedback ,less no of views and likes ,my vidios not reaching to many people , request to you please just give my eligibile feedback to my vidios. tiktok_id :@usernameremoved	7

27-Mar-2020	i love this app soo much ðÿ˜ðÿ’• but i just switched phones and my drafts are gone i never signed out or deleted the app ( it says drafts will be deleted if you deleted the app) all i did was log into another phone... please help i want them back ðÿ˜­ðÿ’” i had unfinished videos waiting to be posted don't do me like this tiktok...	9
19-Apr-2020	this app was a very good one but now there are so many useless updates like i can't even see when someone check my profile or i keep losing followers even if the followers dont do it internationally and when i create videos people copy me and get more famous and when i report it it just gets deleted	2
28-Mar-2020	i love tiktok. this is an amazing app.i really enjoy making videos and i'm pretty much addicted to it.its a great app that ranges from all sorts of dancing to comedy and a place where people show their art as well.i think it is great with all of the filters and how there are multiple audios that you can choose from and even make your own.	17
27-Mar-2020	i like it because i can watch short 60 second video and upload aswell. plus people literally can become famous in one 60 second video. i gave 4 stars because sometimes it can glitch when switching accounts. but other than that it's very good and i think you should definitely consider downloading it. ðÿ˜	7
01-Apr-2020	so i am so angry i had this app like 3 years ago and it worked well and i loved it but then it was time to change my phone to the newest one and click i forgot to transfer the apps so i installed it agein and it didn't work and i tell you that my internet is pretty strong so i tried to use piciphon and one time worked and only, i tried to log in but no connection so not that i don't recommend it but to me its bad!	4
03-Apr-2020	the app is good but now a day my followers count showing wrong. people daily follow my account on tik tok but after a day the count is showing 4683 even now this count is going down and when the 4 to 5 people follow me daily then how the count is showing less day by day. and also i raised a ticket for this but no one responded to my ticket yet.	0
12-Apr-2020	new to this and over 40. the only thing i'd change is not allowing (like a cannot type area) people to write anything down at the bottom or to the right. even with my old boomer glasses on, i can't make out a damn thing. other than that... i love this thing! ðÿ‘ðÿ‘	1
29-Apr-2020	tiktok is very interesting application and i like tiktok so much. but today tiktok disable my liking modes and for this i am unable to support my fans.i kindly request tiktok please enabled my liking system.. i always keep in mind that like others video slowly.me and my fans face big problems because i don't like their videos.and this also effect my tiktok account.. slowly my fans rude with me.i again request tiktok my solve my problems as soon as possible. thanks tiktok. i'd @usernameremoved	11
24-Mar-2020	this app is very addictive but so much fun. there is alot of "drama" which causes so much intertanement and enjoyable times. this app is my most used app and is by far my favourite. tiktok also helps you to express yourself more than you would which has made me new friends. i think this app is definitly worth getting!	6
17-Apr-2020	even though i have raised many times regarding the issue in live video, there is no reponse from your end then y i should use it. and also there are many settings i can't able to see, there's no option of dual video for my videos. does it really mean u r concentrating on my issues very reckless behaviour from your side....	-4
20-Apr-2020	it doesn't let me login to my old account even though i did everything right and also when i accidently made my birthday in 2011 it said i was to young then i put in my real age 2001 and it said i was to young so please fix this its really annoying because i cant get tiktok anymore i even tried to unistall it and do it again but it still didnt work!	-1
18-Apr-2020	while this app is amazing and fun, it overlooks many creators to focus on the ones that are verified. while verified creators have their videos showed to thousands, people with over 1 million dont even get 1% of their followers views.	4
08-Apr-2020	i have contacted 15-20 times but never got reply from your team. also sent an email. no one got back to me. highly disappointed! extremely bad support service. i have an issue with my profile. but anyway! not gonna use tiktok anymore.	-3
29-Mar-2020	tiktok is a good app. it was a good experience at starting using the app. but recently my videos are down. i'm not violating the tiktok community rules but still my videos are not shown in for you. i'm getting 2-10 views and it hurts. i'm uploading videos consistently but the problem is not fixed. i have been reporting the problem many times to the tiktok team but the problem is not solved and also there is no reply from them. due to such issues i am very disappointed with the tiktok team.	-8
24-Mar-2020	the app is good. however, even though the app is up to date, some effects available to other people are not available to me. i am wondering why. for example, the neon cat effect, the dirty face effect, the black eyeglass effect, etc. is there a bug?	1
29-Mar-2020	sometimes it lags but that's my phone and i noticed i cannot pin stickers to anything but again my phone is crappy but i wouldn't give a 5th star because when there's like an ad you cannot swipe it away it just brings you to the site and i don't really care for the site i wanna scroll through tik tok.	-1
08-Apr-2020	i haven't gotten the proper updates like everyone else including the adjusting clips/reshooting after i film, or the new duet formats. i also have a problem with private videos not in their own category like they used to be, and feedback/support center isn't helping.	2
29-Apr-2020	used bto be fun earlier.but not tik tok has restricted the views on videos .so not more than 50 views same above on videos. even that's the scenario.and then it comes that the video didn't match the algorithm. overall someone eho is trying to showcase their telent on tik tok, restricting views just doesn't help. should definitely work on issue.and also as per required condition, even after a minimum of 1000 followersas stated, there vis no option of going live please help	-2
29-Mar-2020	really when i got it i was so exited but next 14 days it became really boring and dramatic so fix it when i tryed to log in the first time it didnt let me so it said {try again later} so i did then i deleated the game because i couldnt its boring dramatic and.........ugly!!!!!	-6
26-Mar-2020	i can only give 4 stars becoz the app is so slow and sometimes when we take a sound to create a video it comes couldn't download sound and we can't create the video we thought to create, but this app is a great app to make creative videos .	5
07-Apr-2020	tiktok is most entertaining app i love to use tiktok very much... but i face some issues in my account... i report my problem repeatedly but not found any solution.... from this reason i'm very upset about your policy... plz it's a request to resolve my issues... i want new features in my account like face template etc.... plz plz it's a request... i want ur answer as soon as possible	7
30-Mar-2020	i can't post i need videos every single time i shared a post video, it keeps on putting it to drafts so tick tock. if you're looking at the reviews, please try to fix your app cause every single time i tried to download it never work, so please to fix it.	3
29-Mar-2020	this app is amazing and the best it is so fun and i gives you the best songs i think it's a great way to learn to dance it is also a great way to speak to your friends and family as you can text on it and it also gives you the popportunity to speak to worldwide people it is really just an incredible app to have . the best part is that you can get famous and you can also report someone if they are bullying you or they have posted something inappropriate for y best application for entertainment..	24
08-Apr-2020	this is one of the best apps i have. i've been making videos for about a month. i'm gaining more confidence about myself. it's addictive too. i'll be on and then there went 3 hours lol. i'm one of those people who where born in the 70s. this app isn't just for kids. love hearing other people sing and have fun. there are people who cheer you up on here. they make you laugh.	12
14-Apr-2020	the green screen effect does not work on android devices and that is just ridiculous. i have an s10 and it still doesn't work. i am not happy with this app at all. basically you have to have an iphone to get special access.	3
08-Apr-2020	some people really hate this app. but its really good. the algorithm is kinda messed up though. i could see someone twerking but as soon as i see a post i like its against the algorithm. but its good for uploading videos.	3
10-Apr-2020	brilliant app but how do i also create another account for my dog to have her own page? birthdays part won't allow but all correct age ? thanks x also before people say it's not allowed i've used other people have tried their email addresses and things it's not for me it's for seperate use! thanks	12
12-Apr-2020	while i shooting my video, while shaking my hands or my body wouldn't be show perfectly,it will seems unclear,and also video is slower than audio, i complained to you so many times , but you are not rectify it,it is very very bad experience, kindly rectify	-5
12-Apr-2020	i love this app. eventhough people are sometimes mean and disrespectful in comments, it's so fun to use and make videos on! it's so fun making videos with ur friends and family aswell. when i'm in a bad mood it always cheers me up because of the funny videos. there are some very annoying things about it though, like how people with 0 followers get on the for you page but not people with 100. i would definitley recommend it but it has some faults!	16
20-Apr-2020	love this app but sometimes when u like a video it says your tapping to fast and doesn't actually let u like the video. this app is fun because u can watch your friends videos and make your own. you don't have to have an account u can just scroll through the #foryoupage which is where u can see videos of people with public accounts. you can text your friends on the app if you become friends with them if u can't get their number u can sign up with your google account , your number etc...	8
14-Apr-2020	its a very good app to show their talents. amazing. but views are not going by compony. compony is suggesting us that make good quality video, well acting. but blur video getting more views and likes. our clear videos not getting views and likes. i am unhappy about this fact. but left of this matter. it is very good app to show talents	10
23-Apr-2020	no views on newly uploaded videos. i'm using hashtags and trending music etc and my own content. however after a few days the video still says 0 views. they need to fix this otherwise i would give it full 5 stars.	0
27-Mar-2020	this app is so nice it has some very funny videos some are weird some are cringe and someone are really bad but most of them are funny, by funny there is something for every one if someone likes weird kind of vids its on app, if you like horror there is some. sooooo yeah something for everyone a bit you wont regret downloading tik tok.	11
16-Apr-2020	it's a great app! it's fun, you can meet new people and make funny videos and watch other people's funny videos!. tho it does have a couple of problems that do need to be fixed other then that it's great! any one who gets the app will be pleased!	12
18-Apr-2020	its fun. but between the guidelines being inconsistently enforced, a lack of response on all customer service inquiries, and the constant threat of a single violation on videos or comments having your account completely deleted, i cant recommend the app.	-4
10-Apr-2020	this app is awsome it allows access to texting friend, sending messages on other apps posting/sharing to other apps there's a lot of trends to follow and music that you can spice up in your own way this app also has sooo much more great values to offer i highly recommend checking it out!! hope you enjoyðÿ’•ðÿ’•ðÿ’•	7
27-Mar-2020	i really like this app. altho i would really love it if they would make it vertically cuz i have a tablet and i can't charge my tablet and be on tiktok the same time so that's very annoying please do something about it. and it's also very laggy :(	2
24-Mar-2020	i would put this as a 5 star but i can't seem to get one of the effects working. the effect i want to get working is the video green screen. but other than that it would deserve a 5 star i am so addicted to this app like once i'm on it i can't stop ðÿ˜ƒðÿ˜ƒthanks for making tik tok tik tok â¤â¤	2
01-Apr-2020	fun app but please add where you can follow as many people as you want in a certain amount of time what i'm trying to say is whenever you follow a lot of people at a time it says your following to fast so please fix that it would make the app more fun to certain people and in general	13
11-Apr-2020	why does my tik tok app display the term no network connection in several times.i tried to clear cache and turn on all the permission and then turn on and off flight mode but it seems doesn't work correctly and this problem began from last few days,so does it have any way to fix it eventualy?	1
04-Apr-2020	it's pretty ok, very addictive and the recommendation process is so quick. one thing that confused me is the lack of support for effects like green screen video and such, and i have a note 9. is there a list of devices supported or plan to be supported in the future?	8
04-Apr-2020	never liked this app because every ad i seen was teens until i started seeing older people using it i thought i'd download it as a joke. i did and ended up loving the app. tiktok knows what i like and always keeps me entertained. if i could rate the app more than 5 stars i would.	6
12-Apr-2020	i don't mind the interface but the content is 80% absolute trash of the worst kind. 10% challenges that are mildly interesting and 10% funny. uninstalling after seeing kids kill a bird, smack their pets in the face, cause and film car accidents and think it was hilarious to post. grow up "content creators" and tiktok maybe deal with this psychopathic humor better	-4
17-Apr-2020	i give this app 4 stars because i had it this summer and it was great but when i try do make a video it deletes. i was working on a video for about two hours and it kept crashing and when i was done it just deleted. good videos, terrible app.	3
05-Apr-2020	if your almost 41, like myself, this is a highly entertaining app. the only problem is once you open it and watch a video, you will fall down the time blackhole and come back out 6 hours later. don't say that i didn't warn you!	0
05-Apr-2020	my only problem is that the green screen effect isn't apparently compatible with my device, which is rather annoying, as my phone isn't a very old model, unless it's just a samsung thing. in which case that is super annoying because i would like to use the effect.	-1
15-Apr-2020	it's the best video maker app .. i think this app is a platform where everyone show there hidden talent of acting , fun , sense of humor , dance , etc.. no one gets bored by this app and the best thing is this app is liked by all age group of people! ðÿ˜šðÿ¤—	13
16-Apr-2020	enjoy the app but the new stitch feature allows users to steal content and not credit original creators, i do not support that, please remove that feature. many creators are having to turn duets to mutuals only because of this. thank you.	3
26-Mar-2020	good app...very fun& entertaining..but...i logged out my a/c automatically...how to get it back?plz help me...i forgot my number now...which is used to loggin. it's asking email to loggin...but i dint use any email id earlier...no number,no mail id....but now i want to loggin my earlier a/c? wats the solution?	11
21-Mar-2020	i like the videos and all, but when i try to text someone, they tell me to my phone number in it then it says that my phone number it's taken so now i can't text anyone in it (ps i got this new phone from a few months ago)	2
08-Apr-2020	i would like to give it 5 stars, but won't. the reason is because l do not get notifications from people l follow. i get nothing at all, l need to go to the app directly and then look for new content from people l follow and that's not good. i already checked all settings in my phone and in the app and still the same. maybe it's me, my phone, or simply it doesn't like me.	4
01-Apr-2020	i think it would make the app alot better if when you follow people all the videos come up in your following it's just really annoying but other than that it's an awesome app. cause i want to follow lots of people but all the videos go into my following it's just so frustrating if you do that i will consider a five star rating	3
25-Mar-2020	so good. popular hone mein time lagta hain. education,health,sports,news,tour, emotional, etc all types videos are made in this application. you can make short videos by using various features. no time break. you have to make control on the time you spend on tik tok. summary:- install it. it is good to entertain. sir , please add a time break feature in this app. which can control how much time we are spending in tik tok. please like my description . thank you.	14
06-Apr-2020	the videos are awesome. what is extremely annoying is that tik tok plays favorites with some people and thanoses others for no good reason my big problem is that i have another account that i can't get into that has my phone number. i want it deleted but i cant access it. there is no way to talk to a support member to take care of this or they make it impossible to find.	3
10-Apr-2020	it shows an error no network connection! i have tried a lot of vpns and tried signing up slot. using different methods and different locations. doesn't work!	-3
26-Apr-2020	i would first like to say something about how people (including me) have forgotten their i formation for logging in and have downloaded this app and have linked their number to the app to text others by sending people vidoes and etc. i am one of those people who has now made a new account for that exact reason, now i cannot text or reply to people who text me through tiktok, and honestly, becuz i have forgotten my information (like a dummy lol) i can't respond to people sadly, i don't want to-	3
29-Mar-2020	i gave it a four star because i like the app but, it has a stupid notification process. say you like something from someone but you didn't follow them it will send you notifications of what they post and it gets annoying, but over all i like the app.	4
31-Mar-2020	i am addicted. i use this app every day. i love it so so much and i think you guys will to. the only downside is you need internet for it to work. you can make cool, fun videos that you can dance or sing along to with friends or even by yourself! happy tik toking!	8
22-Mar-2020	this app tik tok is really amazing and good i have been on it sense musically and ever then its been so good , i would recommend you get this app tik tok and do dances lip sync ! really amazing app you could do whatever on it but it can't be inappropriate because tik tok will take it down or somebody can report you video . over all, i think its a really good app ! you should download it	17
12-Apr-2020	i love this app and the challenges.... but someone keeps removing some of my challenges and not explaining what is so wrong with them??! i had seen alot of the challenges looking the same as mine so not sure why mine are bejng removed hut others aren't?? apart from that it's a good app	16
09-Apr-2020	it's very entertaining and very fun no pop up ads and overall s good app :) the only thing that could use work though is certain filters dont work for certain phones. like i was trying to use my greenscreen filter and it said it wasnt accessible for my device.	15
21-Mar-2020	this is a waist of time, i get so many tekst from tik tok it want even load! i wait 10 min and nothing comes up! i leave 24 hour but nothing works & when i report this problem what i get is: sorry we couldn't report, and even with the log inn: sorry we couldn't log inn try again later... ( what) tik tok fiks this problem	-6
19-Apr-2020	it's great and all, but i can't send messages unless i link my phone number. i can't even do that because i have a new phone number and whoever previously had it had an account and now i can't use my number.	3
24-Apr-2020	this app is very much good but my uploaded videos r not coming in home screen i haven't receive a single like on any videos. that's why i deleted my all the videos, not for only me but all the user's videos should come in home screen. my uploaded videos was not so bad, other videos matching with my uploaded videos have received millions of likes	7
28-Mar-2020	its cute, im old af 51 but enjoying this app so much. i do not like the fact that us older generation moms are frowned upon. my daughter is 11 and i have more 11 year old kids as friends as i can relate to them better and listen as i have more patience being a late mom. it rocks. thank you tik tok. follow me if you want it's jeanettevanzyl.	9
06-Apr-2020	it's a amazing app and stuff like that. one thing that is annoying is that i wanna change my username but it won't let me. i wanted 30 days and more and it still won't let me. tik tok please fix this!!!	5
18-Mar-2020	tiktok is a cool app but the only problem is that i cant like videos anymore bc is saying that your tapping too fast and i'm not i'm tapping really slow i tryd to close the app and then to see if i can like videos but it doesn't let me and its getting annoying :( but everything else is okay	-1
14-Apr-2020	it's a great outlet and makes me laugh but some of the trends cause cyber bullying and make fun of communities such as the cosplay and the lgbtq+ communities. overall a fun experience but still some negativity. three stars ***	10
31-Mar-2020	i love this app but it sometimes assumes your doing something wrong and it just removes your video so then you gotta keep reposting it. also when people go live they block them bc of community guide lines even though they aren't doing anything, i still love that app thoðÿ™‚.	3
07-Apr-2020	wow. amazing. i'm attracted to this game and i have no words to describe how amazing it is but one this that i dont like that this app had made me so adicted like so so adicted which is not good for my health and no one's health so i rate this a 4 stars! well done!	5
26-Mar-2020	this isnt exactly a rating, but i have an idea, i think it would be really cool and efficient if tiktok let us create folders for the videos we save to favourites (like insta). that way we wont spend ages looking for that one video we saved but cant find because we have so many other favourite videos that we couldn't just not add them to out favourites folder. tiktok please consider my idea.	12
10-Apr-2020	this app is great but the green screen effect doesn't seem to be working not to mention my phone's not an old model (newish model) and no matter how much i update it the green screen isn't available	1
14-Apr-2020	this is a very addicting app very good the hud and the layout are basic and great but this new update is horrible i would give 5 stars if you guys removed it because it is annoying getting notifications for the videos that i dont really care about and people that i dont follow the concept was good just take of the notifications for it it is getting really annoying to even use the app while i'm getting notifications every second of videos that are just trying to get views from the notifications	4
21-Mar-2020	this is an amazing app, there are lot different videos and you put in what you like and that's what you watch!!! like sports, funny, art, music/dances, and a lot of youtubers have it!!!!! so you can search and watch their videos!! that is why i rated this app 5 â­'s.	8
09-Apr-2020	it is amazing i just wish you would not have to use your email or phone number i wish you could just make your own like write your user name and make up a password but over all it takes up basically my whole day there is nothing bad about it, it is amazing. i know like 50 dances. it is amazing! i don't understand how it got a 4.5 star review it is the best app ever i love love love love love love love it!!	39
09-Apr-2020	oh tik tok, this is a really amazing app but the reason i gave it 3 stars is because its really hars to function i do love that there are no apps! because me and my online best friend wanted to see each other! i was struggling on making my account public overall tick tok is really fun! ðÿ˜š	8
18-Apr-2020	this app is honestly the worst you can get. tik tok you need a fricking moderator because ppls videos get taken down for the stupidest and most ridiculous reasons. and your app is so biased to apple devices i shouldn't have to bye an iphone to work the greem screen effect. don't get this app. getting stalked on facebook is better than this unfair, bias and hypocritical app. anyone can post a video and it will get taken down for no valid reason dont waste your time and hard work on this trash.	-11
11-Apr-2020	i love the app because i downloaded it last year but now... when i open the app...i can't do anything and i can't log in too because it says i don't have a internet connection...but i have it...also i can't report a problem...and if i open the mobile data it says also i don't have a internet connection.... thanks....	3
24-Mar-2020	great app, i use it all the time. i also like how you can vary what you see. i was getting tired of all the popular tiktokers and the viral videos because i mostly want to see the funny videos or the cosplayers. now that's all i see. great 10/10 would recommend	14
14-Apr-2020	application is good and best but verified account number like and view butter and my account video best quality best but no like and view only view (200) mixmum way i m very hardly working time full on tik tok and all users me like and comment but my i'd all social media available on name to search cbf777 i m sorry but please my account view and like (my tik tok i'd name usernameremoved)	21
26-Mar-2020	the app had a great potential but it became a huge self promotion and low effort content based on trends, people doing the same dance or joke as the trends, think of it as a low budget youtube but no creator there can make a content you want to watch for more than 10 to 15 sec	6
12-Apr-2020	the content is cool but the app needs work. if you want this, you have to be prepared to download all the videos off to watch because for some reason, despite complaints, they still haven't made it so you can watch the video without the caption and hashtags in the way. super annoying	6
22-Mar-2020	it's so addicting and it's the best app. i felt entertaines whenever i was on the app and you can talk with your friends about life hacks on here as well. some of the life hacks don't work, but they are really entertaining. 5 stars	3
29-Mar-2020	no internet connection error at all the time, while i have no internet connection and the website works fine for me in the browser. only the mobile application has issue, and i have contacted you but yet not resolved, it's disgusting.	-3
06-Apr-2020	hi, i can't access the adjust clip option or the add my sound option on tiktok (and maybe more but i have only tried these two so far). my phone is redmi y1 lite and i don't know if it's because of the model of my phone. even if it is, is it fixable?	3
15-Apr-2020	honestly, for a time wasting app, this was great. easy to use, easy to just look at videos and have a good time. content for everyone no matter your likes. i gotta say i was impressed with the cheer amount of silly and funny videos.	11
26-Mar-2020	i love the app! it makes my day better and when i'm bored it makes me entertained! the only thing that irritates me is that my posts don't get on the fyp a lot, and if they did i think they would get hundreds of thousands of likes, maybe even millions.. would you please make my videos get on the fyp?	4
22-Apr-2020	hi tiktok. i love the app and i am very active on it too. but the problem is that i don't get many views on my videos. i get 40 to 60 views on a average on my videos. even after posting the problem with tiktok team in the app my problem is not resolved. i see videos with no beauty or creativity gettiing millions of views. its shocking. and troubling too. please reslove the problem of my views to get more and more views, likes & followers. i love tiktok. please help me. my id- _abhii__07	7
12-Apr-2020	tiktok is amazing app but in these days i dont know what happend to my tiktok account no views and no likes are coming on my videos and i cant see my private videos also my tiktok is not working well i updated so many times but still same problem coming i reported so many times thats problem but no reply came from tiktok team so plz if tiktok team reading this comment plz help me my account on tiktok is usernameremoved if this problem not solved i will delete tiktok from my cell and never use it	-3
19-Mar-2020	everytime i go from one video to the next. the first video plays perfectly fine. but then the next video is black but somehow i can hear sound. my internet connection is great so i know that's not it.	6
29-Mar-2020	so far i'm on it more than any other social app, have more fun, laughs, tears, amazement, etc.. so many creative people, so much learning available & can search & find any interests besides the ones served up from start. loving it!	5
28-Mar-2020	it very good but there is only one thing i i don't like it is that people at the tik too is going back to musicele and every acc that is undor 1000 follower well be deleted every one says and one more problem that there is swear words and i don't like that cuz i like more nice word them swear words	6
28-Mar-2020	it's awful. takes down good content but leaves 14 year olds pimping themselves out to 40 y/o men and 5 year olds on the app. don't reccomend if you like being able to go back to old videos cuz they'll get deleted w/o telling you or the sound will be taken off(again w/o telling you) i've seen content creaters get their own audio of just talking get taken down for "copyright infringement" when it was just them expressing their opinions. tik tok is an awful homophobic app you should never use.	-1
27-Mar-2020	it is a fun way to express your self and get to know a lot of people. i love how it sets you up with recordings and such, sometimes though you won't be able to find the exact ones you need, but that doesn't matter. it is a really go app and i really enjoy using it.	9
29-Mar-2020	i think this is a great app but its just that my tiktok password is not sent to me...but its still a very good app i just hope that you can fix that problem because i what to do another account but i don't wanna lose my other account so pls fix that problem still a great app tho!btw i have an android so maybe that might be the problem?	8
28-Mar-2020	hands down an entertaining app. love the creative side that people bring to the table . don't change it to much as i like the rawness of it all . i'm yet to be game to do a few of my own . i'm learning by watching others .	9
08-Apr-2020	what is going on? it's been weeks and i can't "connect to network" in the app. even though i am. i tried vpn no vpn, cash clear, data clear, uninstall/reinstall. and still says i dont have access to the internet.	2
17-Apr-2020	this app is amazing. it's where you are free to express yourself and it's full of such great content. seriously i recommend downloading and no, this app is not just for children. in fact you will find their are some tik tok famous boomers on this platform. so yeah i think i made my point. download today!!!	9
16-Apr-2020	i like this app a lot, but i really wish when you close your freaking phone it would pause the video. it's really annoying when you go to unlock your phone later and it just starts blaring something random at the worst times....	-2
19-Apr-2020	amazing i've started making videos for fun and it is life changing. if you are alone tik tok is the app for you. the videos can range up to comedy, dance, cosplay, and more. this is a great way to communicate to others or old friends. i love this app!	8
21-Apr-2020	i have an up to date phone it's literally just been bought a few months ago and it's a 2018 model and yet the green screen and voice over effect wont work on this, but on my old phone it would work. i dont get it.	0
16-Apr-2020	i wanna give 5 star but need 2 improvement. 1 must have video auto next option . 2 and there must be video dislikes option . like in youtube or other app have . this option ll help the people who must have to work more for marking video and make it goid for next time . thank you	8
16-Apr-2020	i love tiktok but unfortunately they have deleted two of my accounts, and all of the emails that i have sent have seem to be ignored. i'm not sure when i'll get my account back but tiktok really need to fix this issue.	3
19-Apr-2020	it's a great app for creating, but i have one request: the app makes me feel horrible when my account suddenly gets 0 views per video. all my videos before did decent, now my account is dead before it even starts. also, the stitching feature is dumb as hell.	-6
17-Apr-2020	it's a very good app. whenever you're bored you will always find something interesting. the only thing is the filters to find the right face filters that go with the trend is sometimes hard but it would be much easier if we can search the filter while creating the video.	0
19-Apr-2020	tik tok is a really fun app except that i really liked it before better i wish that i can pick whatever theme i wanted like funny and dramatic i'm so sad they got rid of that i deleted my account so many times because it just got really old and boring to me but it is a really fun app to do some videos with friends but it is really getting on people's nerves and making them to assess with it and it's a great app but it's really annoying ðÿ˜•	14
27-Mar-2020	we have a lot of fun watching everyone's videos. there's some very talented people on tik tok! would love the caption/hashtags to fade out after a few seconds though, so you can read any text put on the video at the bottom.	7
18-Apr-2020	when you are editing text and you set the duration and you are not in the beginning and you press play, it restarts the sound instead and it still plays the video from where you were. but anyway, the apps still good.	0
15-Apr-2020	i love this app but as an android user i'd like to use dark mode because it hurts my eyes to constantly look at the white background. i don't have any problems besides the dark and light mode for android. i'd love to see this feature and it will give me a better experience with tik tok	6
13-Apr-2020	this application is that it serves as a great form of entertainment. with this application, they can dance, expand their friend's network and hone their creative skills too. this application assures a video-sharing community that is real, raw, and without any boundaries. i like this app..ðÿ˜˜ðÿ˜˜ðÿ˜šðÿ˜š	8
09-Apr-2020	i love love love this app, i spend hours in it! but i would love to be able to use certain filters like green screen that are "not compatible with my phone", so if you fixed that i'd honestly give it 5 stars	15
02-Apr-2020	i love tiktok but when i try to make a video it's not recording properly.. the video is getting captured very slowly... i don't know why it's happening to me only while others tiktok app is probably. i request you to solve my issue asap.	4
01-Apr-2020	hii i love this app but everytime i download tik tok it won't let me search account's or when i search for songs it dont work. then it says i cant follow anybody and i can't comment or make videos so if this gets updated this is a five star app but if this doesn't get fixed i'm going to give it three:/	1
07-Apr-2020	its awesome my babies love it. great layout and easy to learn any of the dances you like. i wish it were easier for me to get tik tok fans ive been usung it for 2 1\2 years or for however long it has been since they switched and changed its name from musically to tictok	12
02-Apr-2020	tiktok is very fun and it makes you go creative but sometimes it can get lagging. but most of the time it's perfect. it's also very educational. the only downside about it is that it takes up quite a lot of your storage especially if you have the type of phone that i have.	4
15-Apr-2020	i love tiktok and it's so addicting but a couple months ago i came across tiktok rewards and i redeemed a $5 gift card. i've been trying for weeks to redeem another one but it says either"no reward available" or server error." i even emailed the email address given to solve the issue but i never got a response back. please fix this.	13
10-Apr-2020	alot of people like to do quotes from movies, shows etc. it is so hard to find these things. i some people use these recordings and yet if i have one, it gets muted. you can search a d use better stuff on dubsmash. fix!	3
25-Mar-2020	it's full of all sorts of videos; educational, funny, cute, scary, artistic, sad...anything you can think of! the only issue i really have is that there is an insane amount of bullying and there is a lot of inappropriate content. a majority of the videos i see are not pg-13, but most of the viewers are kids. maybe there should be a filter the creators can put, to keep certain ages blocked from seeing their content? also, bullies need to be banned.	-3
21-Apr-2020	i love tiktok best app ever until last update now messages keep popping up saying the phones proccess acore has stopped working i've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app i had to factory reset my phone i tried a third time and still no luck i hope it can be fixed and soon trying to make the of quarateen life	8
26-Apr-2020	i have been using this app since last 2 years.and i have also made many types of videos. all new content is created slowmo,story, funny & comedy videos i am making also made in my own voice but no use it does not make my video viral. dear tik tok team can you tell what is missing in our video???	12
18-Apr-2020	the app doest not work in iran even with vpn! it detects the location by sim card and it look like that nearest server to iran is corrupted now! tiktok didn't fix it for more than months! it it purposeful or a mistake? ps: the app is working without sim	4
25-Apr-2020	tiktok is the best . although the maximum number of accounts you can have are only 3 on one device and that sucks . second thing is , some effects dont work on certain devices plz fix this. i spend hours and hours in tiktok and i highly reccomend it to all of you install it now!!!!	1
28-Mar-2020	a fun way to express yourself through lip sync, dialogue or just speaking for yourself. awesome how you can interact with strangers from all over. i wish you were able to like a video without it saving to you favorites automatically.	13
29-Mar-2020	i love this app it is the best app i have ever used you can record videos and even favorite the song you like so that to can listen to them and also favorite videos and favorite you hashtags you can place filters over your video and edit it and even make it the speed you want it to be!	15
06-May-2020	it's a nice app.i love it. but i have some problem.my views is not increased. i saw many video their video without beauty and their videos view crossing million . i don't say it their video is not good. they also make good video.but i also try make good video but my video view is very low.this is my tiktok id : (@usernameremoved) please check it and help me to viral my videos	21
31-Mar-2020	this app is awesome but when it comes to liking the tiktoks that's the problem. because if "you" tap the like button or if you tap about 10 tiktoks it's says "you are tapping to fast" it takes 1-2 hours for me to be able to like again	10
02-Apr-2020	there needs to be a section on your profile for last 10 videos viewed. when you view a profile and then go back ,the last video you viewed will sometimes disappear, being able to see the last 10 or even 3 videos would help that.	2
21-May-2020	what 's the hell yesterday was there update of tik tok and today also and yesterday my 10% data was left and i see only 5-10 videos and my data finished and 16+ cannot comment videos on tik tok and no dislike option if there is 0 star option in rating of play store i would give it 0 â­	-8
11-Apr-2020	tik tok is very good and entertainment app . we can easily make videos and have fun ðÿ˜š. it is very famous app.it entertains people.we can make a number of videos with songs.people make many types of videos such as funny ,etc. we make our own profile. this app is good for recording videos. tik tok is a social media platform for creating , sharing and discovering short music videos. tik tok is a very popular app that delivers interesting and unique special effects to make wonderful shorts. ðÿ˜š	25
03-May-2020	listen. y'all think you'll be too old for this app, until you download it and lose 4 hours your first time using it. 10/10 recommend this app to everyone. it's got content for everyone. the content creators are kind and interactive. the videos are fun, silly, recreatable, and can even be educational.	4
15-Apr-2020	sorry, but the application does not work for me since the 10.04.2020 update, it shows that there is no internet, although it does and all other applications work. i tried to clear the cache and reinstall, but nothing helps. what to do?	1
07-Apr-2020	no doubt tik tak is a platform for the up coming talented people to prove their efficiency in the acting and to show their facial and bodily expressions according to lines of lyric..as a super senior citizen i am enjoying a lot and feeling utmost satisfaction on hearing old melodias tunes and also the super acting of this generation ...but it is not out of place to mention that some of the people are acting volgouraily and creating some hatredness to wards tik talk.by using unparlmentary words	8
27-Mar-2020	i love everything about tiktok. the only thing that i wish was different was that you could edit your video, like be able to delete parts of your video without deleting the parts after it or before it and all of it.	6
23-Mar-2020	for me tik tok is an amazing app. it letts me see what other people are doing and letts me show the world what's up! the only thing that bothers me is that it glitches often and crashes. please fix this!	3
06-Apr-2020	i love it!!! the only thing i wish was that if you make a tiktok and only want a specific people to watch it maybe there could be an update on that. also specific people to not watch it as well. over all it is very entertainig and you can get really addicted.	5
08-Apr-2020	i love it with all the letters and soul i stopped using it because i didn't knew how to use the tools now i'm back, and with all this tutorials of people posting them on tiktok i learn more and more each day this is the new way to have fun, people from my generation are rocking it more because we are the generation that created and grew up with the internet so if we would have this tiktok app in our days, millennials would had been crying asking us how to use it but now is on let's play tiktok!!	0
28-Mar-2020	funny, awesome and hilarious. best social media i have ever experienced! all the creators are so creative, hilarious and inspiring. love the app! although tbh it is kinda addicting so if you want a normal sleep schedule maybe don't try this app. otherwise i love it!	18
06-May-2020	this is an amazing app, but i really prefer musically better, musically had a variety of appropriate sounds and i now whenever i am scrolling through my foryou page, there is inappropriate sounds and videos and musically had none of that, so please make this app mkre appropriate, but besides that it is a huge app and barily takes up any storage, you can also have a private acc to post whatever on and not have to worry abt the type of ppl who are watching you!ðÿ’› and still stay sage on here! 12+!â‡	5
03-Apr-2020	it's a good platform to express yourself through dance and singing but some people don't do it that way amd because of that other try not to try it but at the end it's your own opinion. its a fun app,you can make videos and just enjoy your time:-)	11
08-Apr-2020	very good app but there is a problem in the for you only video of famous people appear so, those are normal people how they will get be likes, shares,comments and views if you will make sure that all videos will appear so this is the best app.	6
12-Apr-2020	i am not getting even single view and also i have change 3 to 4 account and again going nothing so i have decided to delete my account but see i am not able to detele my account also. what the hell tiktok. i also giving report a problem but last 1 year not getting any response from your side..	-6
09-Apr-2020	awesome, all i'd like to see is some more easier tools for video editing....some of the simplest things don't stand out and trying to find out how to do certain things seems to be very hard....but overall, great fun app ðÿ™‚	10
09-Apr-2020	i liked this app alot at first cause you had comedy and cosplay but now all i see is little girls exposing their best friend's for cheating or their man's for cheating and the people in the comments always encourage it, like honestly it's made me realize that the next gen has no future at this rate.	1
26-Mar-2020	tiktok is awesome yes you may get addicted but it's fun! so through 2018 through 2020 i've had pretty much 5 accounts because people reported me or i would get on tiktok one day and i would go to see my videos and there was no vids and i would have to restart. and the reason why is because i'm posting "inappropriate content" and its literally a girl doing renegade and other dances... so other than that this would be a five star and i recommend using tiktok	7
29-Mar-2020	it worked fine until two days ago, it won't let me make a tik tok, anytime i try to add music or edit a video, or even try to use multiple videos to cut down into one tik tok it'll restart the app. fix it or i'll thanos another star.	1
27-Mar-2020	not happy with this app, i have completed 25.5k follows but not getting live option till now. few days ago i make 2 videos but tiktok cropped my videos and half will be posted... ðÿ˜ ðÿ˜ ðÿ˜  and 30-40 follows are day by day decreasing without any reason... as we show so much efforts in making videos and gets 40-50 views but this app virals stupid contents of others only. thousands of accounts are doing vulgar acts and getting likes or support... ðÿ¤¬ðÿ¤¬ðÿ˜¡	3
12-Apr-2020	tik tok is a great app.but i'm having an issue other than check my notification.videos and audio won't play. since without content i connton going followers and do what i love without judgement. the name and photo on your google profile will appear with your review.past edits are visible to user and the app developer unless you delete them.	6
12-Apr-2020	this is an amazing, excellent,great and super app but once it happened that which people i follow or i unfollow were same in the for you page and in the following page.but some days later it became like it was before. this is a very interesting app.	7
01-Apr-2020	dunno why is tiktok removing my recent 4 videos! ðÿ¤”ðÿ¤¬ i've reported them 3 times, cleared cache, updated app still my friends n family cannot see those videos but i can. there's no community guidelines violation either! tiktok needs to be quick with their technical resolution responses if they wanna stay on top in the market! i'm waiting for the resolution!! this issue is resolved ðÿ˜š thanks for quick resolution.. may you stay in market even when other apps r technically retarded ðÿ˜šðÿ’ž kudos â¤ï¸	9
07-Apr-2020	there are some good videos but when i open it,and i watch some videos it takes half of my charge and there are stupid videos that comes to me and there are also dirty videos. i don't like this app it is soooo annoying and dumb. i will just give this app â­â­ stars	-1
13-Apr-2020	ever since i downloaded this app, i was so excited but whenever i upload something it just not showing my watermark/logo there. even though i reported this problem many times, but still you guys aren't fixing my problem. please make my watermark visible. thank you!	2
05-Apr-2020	this app is absolutely fantastic. i get up each morning to enjoy the silly videos the had been made. they put a smile on my face and help me forget at least for that moment the sickness that has befallen us. god bless this app.	5
14-Apr-2020	hi tiktok manager, hope you are well. thanks for this platform which make people entertain themselves. i am also enjoying this app very much. i am new user to the tiktok. i am facing issues regarding likes and follow rate. please resolve this issue. for this i will be grateful to you thanks & regards arya(rachna roy)	16
17-Apr-2020	would rate 0 stars but there isn't an option. i don't get the direct messaging ban that they put for people younger than 16. i am 15 and i use the direct messaging to send videos to my friends. making the age limit 16 and older isn't going to stop anybody from doing anything. uninstalling until it's changed.	-3
19-Apr-2020	so amazing it has songs ðÿ™œ even me and my brother. even sometimes it doesn't really work ðÿ˜¬. i like to talk but i just done the load it my brother's just played some games not taking up on my dad's full	6
17-Apr-2020	this is amazing!and i love it! its very addicting for me and yea this is the best and i recommend it for all but just because it has adults doesnt mean a hild cant have it.i say if u want it ask ur parents or tell them to get an account so they can watch your videos,make sure your safe and so you dont get hurt.and also put your account on private and ypu will be safe and accept requests from people so you can decide to accept or decline!luckly for me im safe and u should be to!this app is 5stars	14
18-Apr-2020	love it, but lately i cant send the videos to my friends on messenger and that's making me really sad ðÿ˜­ that's why i can only give you a 4 star. and its hard to figure out how to make videos. i want it to be easier.	-2
16-Apr-2020	tik tok is a great app, but i don't like how the adds appear first before opening the app. other than that i like everything else, and if you'd like to have a time waster tik tok is the way to go!	9
15-Apr-2020	its a really good app, but it has a lot of drama and stuff like that. i think musical.ly is a bit better cause it didn't have a lot of drama, please bring back musical.ly :(	6
17-Apr-2020	really fun, you can make your own videos, get followers and friends, watch videos, record yourself reacting to them, or dueting them, some videos may not be suitable for kids, neither is the app originally, but there are kids on the app, ahem, including myself,ðÿ˜‚ and also for teenagers and even adults, overall it's a great app	5
23-Apr-2020	tiktok app is really very bad app.it does not pay any attention to its users.i have reported many times but there was no reply on that.so i believe the tiktok app is very nonsense.we should not waste time running a tiktok. it does not reply to the report of users.your rule is very wrong. just got more than three thousand followers but i have not started live yet. @usernameremoved	-11
16-Apr-2020	this is one of the best apps but it takes up alot of my battery like when my phone is on 100% a couple minuetes later it'll be on 50% or 60% something and i have a problem with that.	3

21-Apr-2020	in this app you can show your talent and your idea's. you can edit your vedios, many types of filters are available on tiktok. you might obsessed with this app. tiktok is too much of entertaining app and you can also make your vedios of your own sound. sometimes tiktok is not giving views on my vedios ðÿ¤”but i really liked this app.	8
12-Apr-2020	its a wonderful app but i wish the follow cap was higher since i follow a lot of cosplayers and feel very bad when i have to unfollow them to follow someone else. there should be no cap on how many you can follow or at least make the cap higher than 10k.	1
14-Apr-2020	it is a great app i love how you can make your account private so weird people dont see your videos, i don't like the fact that people get different updates at different times.	6
31-Mar-2020	it wont even let me on because im on a acer chromebook 315 so if you please, fix that. it has a camera so i will be able todo videos and it has arrows so i will be able to scroll. please fix this! i luv tiktok!!!!!! plus that one star missing is cause it wont let me on and those 4 stars is cause i have it on my phone.	0
06-Apr-2020	i love it sometimes laggy.... today from my view i only saw 2 videos on my page when really i had over 200! i got really scared but dont worry! it was just a glitch and i just had to exit out for a bit and then come back and thw videos were there!	1
12-Apr-2020	it's a really good app i love it but i have an iphone and when i went on to assistive touch and went in to my favorites and it said 'app uninstalled' but when i went on to the actual app it brought me to apple store and then i updated it and when i touch it it still brings me to apple store and on my assistive touch it still says 'app uninstalled' pls fix this	8
21-Mar-2020	this is one of the best apps ever created. you can watch videos and even make them, there are so many options to choose on doing things. and everything is so fun. people can watch your videos and you can become famous, if your looking for a fun and amazing app i surely recommend this one! ðÿ˜ðÿ™ðÿ˜‡	17
03-Apr-2020	the app is fun and i get to see how creative people can be. tik tok is a place where everyone can be there self and i'm happy thet my bff forced me to download it. i have never had a problem with the app in any way.	6
10-Apr-2020	hi i just downloaded tiktok and i m trying to create my account since 2-3 days but it always says couldn't load please try again later and i have been since 2-3 days . please help with the matter. i believe tiktok is a fun app that's why i downloaded it and looking forward to create some good funny videos .	15
10-Apr-2020	i am really addicted to it i totally loved it. but a problem was we cannot make a video when other video is uploading it takeslot of time for uploading a video and for loading sounds..thats it but i loved it good app for time pass and improving acting skills	9
13-Apr-2020	i love this app!! it's amazing,you can make mini music and acting videos,there's no lag if you use the the right phone.its like an app for actors so if your a actor or dream of being a actor i suggest this app.	4
14-Apr-2020	the "reply with a video to a comment" feature sure had good and understable intentions, but it's really annoying. i don't want these notifications. not to mention that people use that feature to self promo and honestly, it's cringy, annoying and just stinks.	0
24-Apr-2020	i actually like the app and enjoy being on it. but my problem is i don't get to end the whole lyrics if i want to record my own video. it just stop halfway and that's it.	2
01-Apr-2020	it is a pretty awesome short clip vid app. definitely love the different background sounds and stuff you can use. need to keep the copyrights for the sounds though. some videos don't have sound anymore because of it.	8
26-Mar-2020	four star. it's a good app i like spending time in it but when is see funny/good videos and i want to see that moment once more i just have to see the whole video from the start please do something about it. it will be alot better app with time bar like youtube or something.	14
10-Apr-2020	the overall app is amazing but it's the fact that you need over 1000 followers to go live. i just wanna go live but i have 256 followers i wanna go live so i can cosplay on the live and draw for my fans:<	4
06-Apr-2020	please bring back or add the option of putting your own sounds in there, just so editing the videos in the app make alot better to watch and listen to rather than recording over, so then people if given the option to are also able to use the sound as well	2
21-Apr-2020	i love this app and have fun on it! its just sucks that android users can't use some of the effects. like the green screen effect. tiktok you should fix this!	6
26-Mar-2020	this app is amazing to make friends and meet other people. it's an amazing app to show your creativity off. there are some downsides but there are way more upsides than downs. 4 out of 5 recommend.	8
12-Apr-2020	love all the creatures and the community. but the support for the developers is none. i had my og account deleted six months ago and no one will answer me why when i did not break any of the guidelines. the support from staff is none and causes a lot of heart ache for us it affects.	-2
14-Apr-2020	super fun! it's easy to only see content that you're interested in by following and liking the hashtags you enjoy. it's easy to waste a lot of time on here cause it is so fun!!! but you can also watch a couple videos and then get off if you want ;)	8
17-Mar-2020	i can't sign up. and i've had this problem since probably 1 year ago then i deleted the app. but now i reinstalled it and still have a problem. also now that i open it , it says no network connection. and i don't know what to do	-8
18-Apr-2020	it's a very good app . i love enjoying making videos and seeing video content of other users its a platform for showcasing our talent. but the only i find uneasy about it is that it covers a lot of storage especially in samsung galaxy j2 so it's good if tiktok will solve this problem earlier overall its a glamorus app	8
16-Apr-2020	it's so fun you can follow people lip sing, a video up to one minute long and if you don't want stranger knowing your account you can make the account private also love it.there are a lot of famous people and there's not just singing there is dancing too. i recommend this app to everyone that like singing and dancing.	14
14-Apr-2020	it's really fun and creative. i have made many accounts but have been banned for no reason. the only thing i have to say is that when u r banned you should be able to get ur acc back not just lose it. overall the app is amazing. 100% would download and keep forever ðÿ’–	-2
15-Apr-2020	it's is very good app but i have one problem in this app. if someone messages me on tik tok then i can't see that messages on tik tok, i can see through notification if i open tik tok there is no message and from my notification i can see that my freind message me on tik tok so please give me a help	-1
23-Mar-2020	i love it i'm so addicted to this app omg i love it so much because you could express yourself and it feels like your not alone because other kid and teens can express themselves there is some haters but mostly love! this can make you show your talents and you could become famous but i dosen't matter it's just a lovely app which kids and teens could do what they want it's like being free in the world to express yourself i love this app so much it's the best to express yourself and just have fun!	22
15-Mar-2020	look when you first get this app its good and all then it starts to suck you in and its very hard to leave. the only thing that i think is good is the people who actually put in effort into their videos. other than that its mostly just "renegade" and "didnt even notice"	2
01-Apr-2020	it's a wonderful platform of creativity and fun dances, but don't forget that tiktok is perfectly fine with sexual predators using their app to gain a following, and will randomly ban you for talking out against those creators. they are perfectly fine with minors accessing the app that hosts groomers and sexual predators with no problem, but god forbid you're overweight or show a costume prop that looks a little too much like a knife. we see you tiktok, and we aren't happy.	18
31-Mar-2020	this is one of the best apps so far, this app allows you to do anything without having a membership. you can find funny content, you can find scary content, and you can find any other type of content. also follow some people on tiktok!ðÿ˜€	5
17-Apr-2020	i love tik tok, honestly. but one thing is stopping me from giving it 5 stars. ok so you know how they do that "you're tapping too fast take a break" shiz. well i took a four hour break and it's still saying that. plz fix!!	2
26-Mar-2020	full screen ads the moment you open the app is a huge turn off. i feel like opening the app less and less knowing that i am going to see an irrelevant ad before even getting into the actual app.	3
07-Apr-2020	its extremely exciting!!a good source of entertainment and a good platform to show ur talent .it might be acting dancing or anything this app is really a very popular app. many people are able to gain the popularity and platform they deserve	16
11-Apr-2020	i have contacted 15-20times but never got reply from your team also sent an email. no one got back to me. highly disappointed! extremely bad support service.i have an issue with my profile. but any way! not gonna use tiktok anymore. bcoz u don't listen my request to resolve issues .	-1

20-May-2020	very boring app..i waste a lot of time in watching videos which are not very creative as well.	-2
22-Mar-2020	the shop is the funnest app you can make videos people can make anything they want you can even have music in the background this app i can write five stars i don't know what does up is the best i can make all kinds of videos but i think youtube is the best even though i don't make videos there but i think it's the best what does app it is the best thing to make videos short videos that you like only one picked up people to see but it goes all over the internet good day bye-bye hola como estas	18
18-Mar-2020	i love this app so much but i have a feeling the reason why it is called tiktok is becausentime flies by. time goes so fast when you are watching things. either waybi love it so much and love making videos on it and seeing creation and funny things.	14
22-Mar-2020	i didn't want to download this, but i've caved and now i love it lol. it's a pretty solid app. great content. easy enough to use. wish we could use 4k video quality, but it doesn't detract from the experience	11
19-Apr-2020	i like the app but i don't have the delete option. i clicked on the three dots within the video i want to delete and the options i have are to send to someone, share it on different platforms or cancel. i have no option to delete. please advise.	4
30-Mar-2020	love this app. gives me the freedom to be the real me is an unreal world. connected me to a community that i had no connection to before (witchtok) and gives me a way to express myself in such a unique way yes there are a few bugs.	2

24-Mar-2020	great app! the only thing is the app doesn't give the same filters and effects on android that it does on apple. also it adds 2 seconds to the front of the songs so that you are off the beat on android.	0
05-Apr-2020	it's a good app and all, but i really miss musical.ly. i mean, the name made a lot more sense, like what is "tiktok" meant to mean? it's an app with freaking music in it!! anyways, overall it's an "okay" app and i do recommended downloading it if you're bored from quarantine.	6
28-Mar-2020	it's a great app.but it needs some updates like telling you who unfollowed.its annoying when you go down and cant figure out who did it.other than that it's a great app exept people do videos where they judge you on your zodiac signs and that's not how tiktok described the app.	6
01-Apr-2020	it is very free and you can be yourself and this is the best app i have on my i phone and it has awesome sounds to grove to and it has so many events and it's just a really cool and fun app to dance to and lip sing to and also it helps a lot of people fall in love it ends up being awesome and that couple is happy together.	25
02-Apr-2020	i really love it. it lets me see different people around the world and what they are doing. it also lets me like and follow people that o would want to see more and what type of stuff they are up to. i recemrnd this app if you like to see people around the world and what they are up to. enjoy	8
08-Apr-2020	after the newest update it will not let me open the app. i have freed up storage and restarted my phone but nothing is working. i have been trying for 3 days. this sucks.	0
31-Mar-2020	excellent app to re dimention ones talent and improvise creativity .dig deep inside to explode hidden abilities, it gives more chances to express and motivate others to inspire to do so & many more unlimited features to work with. easy to use interface makes it limitless... thank you once again	10
28-Mar-2020	i love this app because is it the best and also you can do anything with it like almost anything you can talk with your friends if you put a phone number and and you like house to do almost everything as the notifications in the sounds are so good you should get this app or i'm not your friend ðÿ˜„ðÿ˜„ðÿ˜„ðÿ˜„	15
05-Apr-2020	it is really an amazing app and i made so much videos using this appðÿ˜šit is very useful and a source of entertainment.i enjoy making videos in it. there are many sounds and musics. i can enjoy making videos but i cannot change my username frequently.	10
15-Apr-2020	great app. love the social-ness. i've had it for over a year and some users get more updates and features then others, but still great app!!	9
23-Mar-2020	everything is good in my tik tok but in my uncle phone before he used have tik tok suddenly in his phone someone deleted again he took new phone number in that he want to reopen the app but is unable to login with before id because when is wants to login they are sending verification code to that number ca we login with email	3
20-Apr-2020	litteraly the best app ever! i use it so much and its so much fun! the one thing that sucks is that not all effects work on all phones so that means you cant do certain things but other then that it's great!!	1
21-Mar-2020	this app is a lot of fun, but definitely a lot of flaws involving safety. i urge parents of minors to have a conversation withnyour children about internet safety, but all in all let them have fun! this app encourages everyone around the world to share their creativity and ideas.	1
27-Mar-2020	amazing, tiktok allows you to be creative with your videos and it can have lots of filters.you can describe your videos with hashtags and lots more.you can also make videos and leave them on private or for certain people to see!! tiktok has changed my life and it can certainly change yours!!!!	3
25-Mar-2020	it is super fun and i'm truly addicted and it's such a creative app where everyone can express themselves and have fun. the only complain i have is that sometimes it says i'm tapping too fast and it sometimes doesn't let me like a video for 2-3 days.	13
29-Mar-2020	i absolutely love tik tok it is so addictive. tik tok is very good at the moment because lots of people are in isolation so it gives them something to do. i totally recommend it but the one thing is that i don't think the people who created the app should be deleting videos. this app is fun and entertaining - dixie	14
31-Mar-2020	its really lit and good, it just takes up too much space, but otherwise, its an amazing app yet also, they let people like pedophiles on the app and ðÿ˜¬ so quick advice dont let your kid post too exposing videos unless they have a private account .	5
16-Mar-2020	i love tiktok! it's an amazing app where people can show their creativity. there are varieties of tiktok videos like lip syncing, skits, dancing, and others. overall, i think tiktok is an amazing app and you should definitely download it.	13
28-Mar-2020	this is a cool app. fun. however, i some features aren't available on android devices i see, and that isn't fair. but then again, i'm not surprised. a lot of developers don't really care for their android users......	3
20-Apr-2020	hiii! i love this app and i m very active on is to. but the problem is that i don't get many views on my videos. i get 25to45 views an average on my video. even after posting the problem us not resolved. i see video with no beauty on creativity getting millions of views. shocking & troubling too. please resolve the problem and i love tiktok and want more views on my videos plz plz plzðÿ™ðÿ™ðÿ™	4

04-Apr-2020	tik tok is fun and challenging but it's not always when you make videos and the next few hours or minutes you've received 0 likes and when you check again you've received the same thing again and the next day the same thing again before you join tik tok think about it first think about what your going to do on tik tok please	7
07-Apr-2020	i love this app but sometimes when i am scrolling the app just freezes then exits out of tik tok and says tik tok is not responding please try again later and also tik tok is not allowing me to record viedos it said give permission and i did i tried it multiple times!	4
23-Mar-2020	okay i think its stupid you have to set up your phone number just to send messages to your friends or share videos like come on now i have to use messager but all of a sudden i cant send messages!? thats supid as hell!! some of us cant have the luxury of having a phone..	6
10-Apr-2020	ive never been all that extroverted but this app has encouraged me to try and get noticed for my talents. so many interesting and quirky people on this app. not to mention its a great way to pass time during quarantine!!!	7
26-Mar-2020	i'm enjoying this app very much! just like any social media you have to sift around a bit to find what you like but once you do you won't mind the algorithm so much. could have some improvements but i'm not expert enough to say how it what could be fixed.	6
16-Apr-2020	i love this app and it definitely has something for everyone! i've seen animals, elders, those with disabilities, young children even blow up on this app. would highly recommend! i spend hours at a time on tik tok and would reccomend it for anyone with it's welcoming and open communities.	3

17-Apr-2020	hi.. i would like to say that your app is designed for only those who can spend money on your app.90% videos don't get likes and views are only limited to 50-100. i am very disappointed since i am not getting views and likes on good videos.	6
27-Mar-2020	it's gd but recently i faced some problems like when someone follow me i didn't get the notification . so many layers i get that and also why i play a video it's too slow to watch.so please solve those problems as soon as possible.	0
12-Apr-2020	want to lose hours, days, or possibly weeks of your life and not know where they went? then this app is perfect for you!! want to perfect procrastination? download tiktok and never get anything done, while still feeling productive. self isolation has been ideal. since i've had tiktok, i haven't needed to spend time with family or friends. thanks tiktok	17

05-Apr-2020	i love this app, i got it in june 2019 but i have two very uncomfortable problems, in november 2019, my old account usernameremoved got banned for no reason...i dont want it back anyways. 2 is that on my for you i always get scary videos and i keep clicking 'not intrested' but it doesnt work. one was about a translator that was translating from somalian to polish and the creepy thing was the sound. it was like breaking glass. please solve this problem about my fyp, i dont like scary stuff....	-9
14-Apr-2020	lot's of fun :) tho can u guys quit changing where you put the 'not interested' button because it keeps changing and it's pretty annoying when trying to add a video to favourites and instead clicking the not interested button because that's where the favourite button used to be.	13
05-Apr-2020	i love this app it's funny it's sad sometimes. i have laughed i have cried happy tears and sad tears. love the tutorials, love the life hacks, also the pranks. if you have not downloaded tik tok you should. you will be addicted and spend hours on this app when you should be doing something eles.	7
17-Mar-2020	when i'm editing my vedios,the effects like zoom,windows,misted,shake,etc.is applied peefectly..bt after the posting of edited vedios..the applied effects are not shown perfectly..there is a change in the speed of the running of the effect in the vedios after posting.	2
22-Mar-2020	this is the best app ever you can make new accounts and even join others accounts you can also make videos with friends and when your making a video choose a sound and a filter it will make your tik tok better you can also write stuff at the bottom of your vid try to get viral i dare you!!	6
14-Apr-2020	its really laggy it wouldnt let me cancle my insalation but over all its good oh one more thing i woulde change you would be able to like and follow without an acount so i would recomend it but also not,so yeah this is my opinion and i you can get addictied to it and you would spend time on here instead of family,and yeah	7
29-Mar-2020	it's an amazing app! i haven't had a problem with it until this morning though... i tried to make a video, but it kept freezing. i closed the app and opened it again for a few times, then i reset my phone. it still didn't work, besides that, it's great!	2
16-Apr-2020	started using this app back when it was musically and never really got on but since it became tiktok or the new vine should i say, i find it rather creative and hilarious, the algorithm for growth is one of the best from having no followers to having viral videos in a matter of days because they know how to share content to all and unlike youtube support everyone's content created its just pot luck if people like and share, but youtube just don't promote your videos at all haha	18
27-Mar-2020	very fun and creative it make me happy when i am sad and a very good time pass vidoes and very fun to make vidoes and the new trends are very fun too i just love it and would other people to install it too but not that young people of the swear words that are in this app but other then it is good for even young people.	22
22-Mar-2020	i love this app you can make dance videos music videos or you can cosplay and you can make a new friends on there and get in contact with your old friends if you know their tik tok account and you can just have fun on their this is a great and amazing app but the only thing i would have to say is that tik tok please get small accounts noticed.	15
10-Apr-2020	when i make a video it won't let me edit the clips. i press the check to start editing and at the top right corner i only see the "filters" button (and voice effects if i don't put background music). i'm using a moto g7 supra. this is super frustrating but would give 5 stars if fixed.	3
18-Apr-2020	i like the app but some of the effects don't work on my device and i'd like that too change because most of the effects don't work for android only ios for example one of the effects that don't work for me is green screen.	4
28-Mar-2020	tiktok is an amazing app to cure boredom and communicate with friends. the dms option is great however i feel like you shouldn't need to connect a phone number to your account to use this feature.	9
30-Mar-2020	hello, i can see that everyone is using the app and i find it totaly cool. but all my friends in serba are having the sound clips on serbian, i live in germany and i do not have serbian in setup options. can you please help me?	6
18-Mar-2020	an absolutely amazing experience with all kinds of humans. not just dance but the dance is really fun and we certainly could use that now. runs excellently on my moto g6. the only issue is they need to make their titles hidable so you can see what people write. do it!	8
25-Mar-2020	wow amazing that what i said a few week ago this app is the best but i have only 1 problem i have been uploading videos on my tik tok channel but suddenly all the new videos will just not work and will be saved to draft i was really confused because i had wifi and enough storage space but it still didnt upload and i have been losing followers lately someone plz help	2
21-Mar-2020	there are a few problems with tiktok... first, i cannot buy coins at all, there is no option when i click balance. 2nd, i cannot go live even after having more than 1 thousand followers. i'm well over 18. 3rd, their support doesnt reply at all when you report these issues to them. 4th, videos randomly gets deleted for violation of community guidelines eventho they are not against the guidelines. if tiktok continues like this, many creators are going to want to leave this platform.	-4
20-Mar-2020	it's fun, but tiktok really needs to fix all of the stuff on the screen blocking where people write. just have it fade out or something a few seconds in, something simple like that would work.	1
19-Apr-2020	tic toc'ers are all about having fun and making fun and sometimes don't do that please! videos. i'm so glad that i'm not the only one in need of an therapist.ðÿ˜‚ thanks to those who aren't afraid to toc, when they should've tic'd. when i get internet connectivity that isn't stupid and slowly toggles and waste time and data, i will be able to use this app as intended and will finally be a actual participating tic toc'ers videographer, as well as commentator's.	8
25-Mar-2020	a very addictive app that i'm happy to use, has different types of videos which make me laugh. this app really puts joy into my heart, the might be some downs but i'm happy to say this app is a 5 star. perfect app keep it up!	12
15-Apr-2020	ok so i dont know what this new update is where people can comment videos under comments that you like and you get a notification for but it needs to stop. i dont know who had the idea to do something like this, but i get so many notifications from the same guy who keeps doing this over and over again. i dont see how it is a very useful thing on the app i fully believe that it should be gotten rid of in the next update.	6
04-Apr-2020	i love tik tok! nothing but fully loaded hilarious, cute, emotional and/or random videos that are guaranteed to get you through your day. i recommend following #copsoftiktok. remember: time spent on awesome videos is not time wasted! even if you did do it all. day. long. lol â¤	12
13-Apr-2020	tik tok is a funny and interesting app with loads of different possibilities including dance,comedy,singing,art,duets. although, tho do except funny stares from people that dont have the app. overall tiktok is an amazingly fun app to enjoy in this isolation. if you would like to follow me my name is typical._.mazie._.11 i do free follow backs so all the small creators can all help each other out. :))	24
15-Apr-2020	i enjoy it and it keeps me occupied. i especially like the dance challenges! watching the family videos is refreshing in today's society where there is so much division in our households. i beam with pride when i see our elderly, intellectually & physically challenged share! there are awesome people out there just going for it and bringing forth smiles. we need that especially now.	8
09-Apr-2020	incredible! the only problem i find on it is having a lot of sexual explicit on women videos. girls have no limits on showing theirselves in lascivious ways like prostitutes. i think you can add a new community line guide not allowing sexual material on videos.	-3
13-Apr-2020	well i was watching tiktok and then i think it was glitch and it said "hot list is empty" and i was so confused about that and after it started working and i only saw two videos and the the last t two videos it said you reached the end so you guys need to fix that	-1
15-Apr-2020	very bad , starting i loved it a lot , but it's likes in the starting when they released the app people who used it in starting hav got likes and followers , later only there videos go viral only they get many likes , how good normal people do , no use no likes ðÿ˜¤ðÿ˜¤ very bad i have 2k followers but my recent views are 80 , 95 ,85 ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­	5
19-Apr-2020	this app this big problem,all i follow tik tok community guidelines.and my followers is 1000 abow.but not available live option of tik tok id : jiteshanjna-75, but this app is not working right.so i don't like this aap . tik tok in report a problem to time to time do message.any type no reply . what is this app. bed app.i complain you .last .	-6
16-Apr-2020	this app help centre sucks i try to log in with facebook and it show 'non local user need to redirect to the storage area' and post a complaint in help centre but there is no response from there side and now i can't login to my tiktok account	-4
19-Apr-2020	not all app versions are the same. some of the users have a feature called enhance but a majority doesn't. the app needs to be consistent. and i hear a lot of complaints about their videos getting deleted and likes getting deleted	0
17-Apr-2020	when i block a user their tiktoks appear even more on my reccomended, same when i say im not intrested in a video a bunch of similar videos appear on there. also when i joined for some reason my phone number was already registered so i couldnt message anyone (which is a dumb system by the way) and wouldnt let me fix it. app is full of predators but other than that its good for wasting time on when im hating myself	-6
16-Apr-2020	when i try to forward videos no matter the size it tells me the file is too big to send. if i delete the app and download it again i can forward 1 video before it gives me that error.	1
12-May-2020	hello tiktok team, i love this platform it's fabulous. but the problem this that my account (tiktok_offical_manpreetdhimaan) is fully freezed. daily i'm posting 3,5 videos but i didn't get more than 30 50 view. i see lots off video with no any creativity, na content even iping not matched but tiktok getting millions of views on that videos. it's shocking so please do needful to me i have mentioned my tiktok id hope so you can review it and will solved it as soon as possible support me	3
28-Mar-2020	this is an amazing app. it is very cool and i also like the fact that this app releases new filters through out the season going on or starts. and this is 1 of the best and most popular app and here's why-1.it has less bugs so people use this and never leave 2. this app is full of creativity.	12
30-Mar-2020	tiktok is very very amazing app if we use tiktok very time over videos will be publish as well as we will can't borr and in which we can watch every videos "forexample" in which we can watch the funny videos and we can watch "art .skill. knowledge etc so tiktok is vary vary beautifull app	8
21-Mar-2020	installed it and it says no network connection when i do have one. i even turned my wi-fi off and says the same thing. will uninstall and reinstall to see if that works. if not i'm uninstalling.	-2
22-Mar-2020	if the developers are reading this it would be nice to see if you could make it to where advertisers couldn't disable comments that way we could let the people know if the video is misleading to what the app actually does thank you. other than that the app is great	2
24-Mar-2020	i love tiktok it's absolutely amazing sometimes i learn new things that i didn't even know myself also i very much like that this app allows you to choose your interest and of you want to change it you can do so at any time this app is truly a 5 star app.	11
03-Apr-2020	it's a nice app...i use oneplus 7 pro n i gave it 3 star because when i do slo-mo through this app...it comes shakey but my friends who uses from iphone the slo-mo comes alright from their phone....so i request u to increase the quality of slo-mo in this app	6
29-Mar-2020	i love this app it's perfect for edits im a fellow anime fan so i usually do edits and they turn out amazing from you!! i get the perfect song and on a different app and then i uploaded it on tic tok and even if i dont like the song when im about to post it you guys have the perfect songs for my edits and the perfect filters!!	20
28-Apr-2020	i absolutely love watching the many videos, especially during this mess that the entire world is experiencing. there are some extremely talented people out there. they need to make a tiktok talent show... and model search... comedy acts... and so much more... this is so entertaining that i can stay watching videos all day. i love tik tok !!! everyone keep sharing your amazing videos and please stay home, be safe and protect yourself and your family and friends!!! i love you all â™¥ï¸ and god bless	22
01-May-2020	my slow motion response is improper, as the dubbing before slow-motion effect is faster and timing is not proper. all the words or lyrics are faster like my video lip movement goes fast n words remain behind. kindly look into this matter.	2
08-Apr-2020	it's great! amazing, fun and when you are bored u can film something. but there is one thing tho, when dounloaded it there were no instructions. but that is all and i like it.	3
02-Apr-2020	actually dig this app, its a good passtime and gives your imagination a run for its money. would love for the video editing to have a few more editing options, but overall its pretty cool especially in our given period of time in history, this app should keep well.	8
01-Apr-2020	this is a very great app but the only problem i have is that alot of guys on this app, make shirtless tiktoks and they don't get in trouble for it. i don't think a guy should be able to make a tiktok video without a shirt on. need some bug fixes from the recent update.	-1
14-Apr-2020	worst app ever. whenever i try to follow someone, a message appears saying that you are following too fast. i have updated and reinstalled the app, still it shows that message. do something as early as possible	0
19-May-2020	worst app ever i used in my life. this app drains battery realy fast and my phone gets hot . i am not using this app untill i need to .	0
18-Apr-2020	amazing app! only thing i would add is the ability to add text and other editing tools to multiple photo slideshow uploads, so that we don't have to go to external editing apps to do so before loading and posting.	2
26-Mar-2020	o have using this app for a long time but very rare to gain followers they still feature the videos of others of doing nothing while me still stuck in 0 plays! pls fix this i really hate it when i spend more than 1 hour of transition but gain nothing likes and follows pls be fair dont over feature the video of others i hate favoritism and you still does, 3 more videos and if my video still gets no difference, i will quit using this and rate this even worse	-3
19-Apr-2020	as a cosplayer, i'm starting to honestly hate this app. the algorithm is stopping my followers from seeing my videos. please, please, please fix this. thank you.	1
16-Apr-2020	grate app... want to add more futures... 1.plz add some tamil fonts...and other language design fonts... 2.font outline shadow option wanted. 3.acc owner can't seeing own videos share counts..plz make visible. thats all... otherwise tiktok is a best app... thx to creator.. loving dinesh	8

03-Apr-2020	its amazing im not famous (yet)ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ but i would really like there to be a voice over button so you can click it and make a voice over instead if hearing the original audio i think there was a feature like thus but they took it off so you thats the thing i think this app needs also o.g since (musical.ly)âœœ	10
04-Apr-2020	this app is great i adore all my fans/followers uhm there's always some kind of work that can improve the app, i think it would be nice to be able to add people to the lives and the app could always run a bit faster but other then that i absolutely love the app	14
05-Apr-2020	this is a really good app buti think it should have a choice if you want to skip to the next one without using any hand so something like a voise activator.say i forgot my password we should have a thumb print.i like it because you get a choice to watch your friends or people that are popular also like that you have a choice to make it so everyone can watch you videos or just your friends tick tocks.i think you should change the 1000 follows to 150 followers to go live that is why i ðÿ’œ tick tock	12
12-Apr-2020	it is so fun but something that annoys a little bit is that slot of features or filters do not work for some devices but other than that it is awesome and i highly recommend ,you'll never get bored on this app	6
29-Mar-2020	this app is very good! but i have a problem, i cannot use green screen, it says it's not available with this device, and not only me i have this problem, if it's possible fix it please, but it's amazingðÿ’¯	0
16-Apr-2020	tik tok is an good app to take your stress away and i have and 60 minute timer when i get on tik tok so i want spend all day just watching it or making them. to get the 60 minute timer on your tik tok just go to account info in the settings then itill say 60 minute minimum time and then it'll ask you to make and code after you set it up and your done.	3
15-Mar-2020	this is a great app but the only problem is that i got hacked the other day and now i have to wait 30 days in order to change it, i don't really see how that is necessary. also tiktok won't let me change my number cause i been hacked.	-1
11-May-2020	i think this is a really cool appâ¤ it let's you post videos and express yourself which i love doing. my only suggestion is that my for you page and following are exactly the same so i don't get to see other people's amazing creations. other than that i think this app is really good 5 stars for me! ðÿœÿðÿœÿðÿœÿðÿœÿðÿœÿ + ðÿœ§	11
20-Apr-2020	one of the vital things that we miss and so tiktok videos are not getting views is a time of posting it. appropriate time of posting a video should be such where people are actively using tiktok. ... mostly time around 11 pm is considered to give higher views to my videos. plz tiktok mere videos pe views and like badhaye plz name:- amarjeet kumar user name:- ziddiboy.ak47	2
15-Apr-2020	real fun and entertaining, you just have to invest a bit of time to find the contents that best suits you & then the ai of tiktok takes over to suggest you videos that you will definitely like, find funny or informative. tiktok has it all, give it a try and you won't be dissapointed.	11
27-Mar-2020	whenever i open the app it shows connection error tho i'm sure my internet is working. i reinstalled app but i still can't do anything. *i can't send feedback because off network issue too*. i had account before and now i can't even log in.	-2
29-Mar-2020	i like this app because theirs people enjoying their day like having fun and stuff like that. this app makes my day because i really don't have anything to do at home so i get on the app and there's a lot of funny things and scientific things and stuff like that it's just an app that's like for entertainment and funny. i like the fact that people like posting funny stuff but sometimes sad stuff like freestyling to jocelyn flores by xxxtentacion and stuff like that but yeah it makes my day!!	35
12-Apr-2020	right that's it, i can't bite my tongue anymore.. you're ads are the fuquing worst! i actually hate you. i had to download the app just to vent that. i might have to get youtube premium just so i don't have see your moronic ads every 5 minutes. gaarrrr u suck!	-3
15-Apr-2020	dear tik tak team, this application has been filtered in our country since the beginning of its operation, and we used vpn to use it, but for months now, even using vpn, we have encountered a no network connection error.	-2
09-Apr-2020	i love this app... i usually have very higg anxiery but watching people just be people and knowing im not just the only one that does something or looks different. just makes me feel good.. im constintly laughing and it just helps my day it really does. thank you!	8
22-Mar-2020	i love this app and all but i used to send/share tictoks on messenger and now i cant even send them anymore... what's the problem??i thought it was because i had to update it so i did and it still did the same thing	9
23-Mar-2020	i am still getting the hang of the app, and i cannot honestly describe how the staff works on this app. different from smule and musical.ly? even i am surprised that kids and preteens been watching my videos, even i am aware and cautiously careful while giving out heads-up before anybody play one video or the next. i know some can be misleading or a misunderstanding sometimes, but i'm glad that parents and guardians are aware with rules on tiktok; that way it will help to be astounding app.ðÿ’–	8
26-Mar-2020	cool app to pass time when i am bored. not as bad as people make it out to be, yes there are some cringe things but overall just light entertainment when you have nothing else to do. (like in lockdown). â¤â¤â¤	-2
26-Mar-2020	i live this app so much bc you can dance, sing, lip sing, create sounds that others will use etc and watch other ppl do those things also. another thing is it is pretty customizable to my beliefs. the videos last 60 seconds and i just am in love with this app! def recomend!	4
11-Apr-2020	tik tok is awsome it brought me closer to my friends and it brought me so much joy. i love tik tok because you have the option to be public or to be private it also has something for everybody no matter the age!!!!	3
25-Mar-2020	i love it! the hate gets so bad though, but that's a minor issue, and it will never be able to be fixed because it's not your fault, i love the app it sometimes cures my boredom 5 stars!	0
20-Apr-2020	would be nice to change region since i'm not creating content in the language of the country that i currently live in :/ the application (filters and effects) is also in polish overriding english in the settings.	1
27-Mar-2020	this is an awesome app and every week the new thing is added and it is a great video maker. this app is awesome you can make every type of videos as you wish but it must contain some nice features. thank for the awesome app	21

26-Apr-2020	its fine but it freezes up for like 3 seconds for each video. also, please make comments a higher character capacity. its annoying since they're so many uneducated people on this app thinking they're so smart and everything. i try to explain why their wrong but the character capacity is preventing me from giving detailed explanations.	1
08-Apr-2020	it made realise who i really am and it can connect your old accounts to your new phone just download it and it will connect you can set your own privacy settings every post no advertisement and there is no limit of posts it will delete the interprot ones and you can follow people and text them so i recommend one hundred and ten percent you should download this app	0
10-Apr-2020	i need help! tik toks saying i'm not legible and nothings working. i accidently uninstalled this whilst i was getting rid of some apps on my phone and now i can't sign up again. it's made me really sad because i love this app and now i can't even use it. please help me tik tok	6
26-Mar-2020	good app but it's annoying how i can't use the green screen effect? it says it doesn't work with my phone but i don't see why that should be a problem? can they make it so android phones can use green screen	4
31-Mar-2020	its super fun and u can watch videos and follow famous people and there can be some giveaways. i forgpt to say u can also nake ur own dance videos but u have to sign in with a emil or a phone number. if u want to text your friends u have to have a phone number in order to text them but if not u would have to text tgem in the comments in one of there videos. i think everyone should have this app. its super fun and you have it whenever you r bored or if u just want a app to go to. love this app!!!	19
19-Apr-2020	what a stupid application,if i like the video it will automatically be unlocked after a while. and if i want to find someone's name. so it does not come from other people's names. now i want to uninstall tiktok.ðÿ¥º	2
07-Apr-2020	this app is great the fact that you can make short videos to express your creativity is great you can also watch other peoples videos as well and they are funny but the only downside that i found was that you can talk to other people but they have to follow you back.	8
03-Apr-2020	this app is fun and really passes your time if you are bored. during these past few weeks of quarantine, i have been on this app and it has given me ideas, inspiration, and fun times. i strongly agree that this app is a must	9
11-Apr-2020	it works perfectly fine and was really easy to install. so far i have had no issues except the fact that even though it has all the acess it needs, i cant make my own tiktoks.	5
08-Apr-2020	an amazing app very addicting its just over all 10/10 would highly recommend for downloading!! i really couldnt give it a bad review!! sometimes there is some inappropriate trends but you can report it or unlike it so you dont see much of it but its 98% appropriate!! i just love this app	4
20-Apr-2020	it's a great way to waste time and if you are feeling up for it, waste even more time on making videos. without even realizing it, i've spend 2 hours just making one video. this app is really fun though.	6
20-Apr-2020	i love tiktok, but i'm getting very upset with the "no interested" button and the "add to favorites" button being so close. i have said i was not interested on videos i was meaning to save because i liked them. and there is no way i have found to reverse that. please resolve this issue. i am pissed.	9
25-Mar-2020	after trying to log back in, i couldn't, and made a new account, after a bit of getting use to the videos i was more attacked to tik tok, over all it was an amazing app 100% reccomend to download, especially to kill some time!!ðÿ’™	0
18-Apr-2020	its a good app and all for the most part bit i have had four accounts banned for no reason today was the fourth sometimes i feel like deleting the app for the reason i have alot of memories in it but i lost all of them and its hard to find and remember the people i was following i have had this app since before it was tiktok but i am nkw telling myself if it banneds me one more time im deleting to app.	-4
11-Apr-2020	interesting, funny, entertaining content is provided by users, delivered by tiktok. would be even better if i could cast it to the tv, and screen content to only allow family friendly subjects & language.	7
28-May-2020	lot of vulgar videos. platform is good and i enjoy it but please get rid of filth.	6
06-Apr-2020	i love it! no ads and its great! i can watch tons of videos and talk to people if theure my friends... only problem ive had so far is it said my mic and camera arent allowed or something when they are... but 5 stars from me	0
19-Apr-2020	don't download if you do not have a sense of humor and appreciate the effort it takes to make a 30sec video! otherwise laugh until you cry!! also, appreciate the fact that time travel is possible while watching tiktok! you start watching and before you know it 5 hours have gone by!!!	7
31-Mar-2020	this app is very fun!!!,i have had this app since it was called musicly,and im still having fun on it! tik tok is also very addicting once your on you cant get off and its also very funny to! plus its a good way to hope on some of these trends,you can make cool videos yourself and get likes, followers, and somtimes comments. its a little hard to get followers and likes,but the more videos you put more people will see them,i generally have fun and maybe a addiction to this app!	21
23-Apr-2020	it's a great application when u r alone. sometime it is more convenient application when u have no one to talk, no one in ur life for who u want to spend a time.so that time it is very good to be with tik tok.if you have a dreams and talent of acting then it is good application to grow in your hobby of acting.	11
03-Apr-2020	tik tok is great yes it needs wifi but u can make videos and store them in ur drafts so u can make tik toks without wifi. the only thing i disagree with is that u can also run out of space in tik tok and whenever u log out of ur account and log back in u lose all ur drafts. tik tok is also a way to get rlly famous and get up to 30 million followers like charli. otherwise i rlly recomend this app and not the fake apps	3
01-Apr-2020	honestly this is the best app ever you can learn so many things and make videos and watch them its just like youtube but way better there are 30 to 60 second videos that you can scroll through like, comment, share and follow and you could get famous like the well known tiktok star charli d'amelio there is so much to do i promise you wont get bored.	15
26-Mar-2020	it's not even letting me sign up. even when i don't put in my real birthday it still doesn't work. it keeps on saying "sorry this isn't eligible for tiktok" it's so annoying!! please please fix this immediatley	2
15-Apr-2020	this is really good i love this app, have been doing it for 2 years, in this app, i make videos on this app, but i have some problem, my reviews on my videos.	6
29-Mar-2020	please enable green screen to be used on all devices. this is the only reason i gave 4 stars and not 5 because the green screen effect is not compatible with my device	0
15-Apr-2020	while i do(sort of) like this app i have to give it one star...the adds for this app are annoying as fu*k as they run on my phone every 2 seconds and interrupt everything i'm doing on my phone(like they did while i was writing this review)ðÿ˜¡ðÿ˜ ðÿ˜¤#nothatingjustfrustrated	0
27-Mar-2020	tik tok is a very nice app and fun,it also get strangers to interact with each other and it is safe.it is also unfair that sometimes songs from other countries are sometimes not allowed to be used by another country.	1
16-Apr-2020	i honestly used to love this app. this is why, i don't love it as much. it's just that it doesn't let me log in because someone permanently banned my account for no reason and now i cant have fun and do tiktoks !! sadly ðÿ˜«ðÿ˜ÿ	4
12-Apr-2020	why does the greenscreen filter not work with my device (huawei p20 lite) when i try it says "effect doesn't work with this device" i just want explenation atleast... a bit unfair and frustrating that some can't use all the features that others can.	-3
27-Mar-2020	this is the best app ever but it can get addicted i love it the dances is a little hard and to make one too but so was vine so..... this is way better then vine because you can lip sync but with vine you had to make one with you voice and that is hard. but it gets a 5 ðÿ˜ðÿ˜ðÿ˜ðÿ˜	6
17-Apr-2020	regarding the song selection. i'm not able to upload manually a song. earlier i was able to select a song of my own choice by just uploading it from my device. but not it's not possible.	0
19-Apr-2020	just a fun app. works great only thing i don't like is they tend to shut people down very quickly if someone complains. unfortunately there are a lot of internet trolls that make complain and get people shutdown for a while.	5
26-Mar-2020	it's a decent app that has some funny content. some of it is way inappropriate with young kids talking about grown things. it should be moderated more, and not focus so much on sexualizing people to get followers.	2
11-Apr-2020	whenever i try to duet with someone i can't hear any of my own audio. i've tried it with and without headphones and it still doesn't work. im not sure how to solve the issue but any help would be greatly appreciated.	3
01-Apr-2020	it doesnt always finish the videos, it always freezes near the end. shadowbanning lgbt+, cosplay, etc. also makes me dislike the app, i like how it was before, when the rules and guidelines were actually enforced.	4
11-Apr-2020	why can android users have the same options that apple user have? that sucks! i can't use the bling filter & i can't use the focus filter etc. why isn't it the same for everyone?? this shouldn't even be a problem!	9
11-Apr-2020	tik tok is great. it is so fun and i can watch it for ages. it really is great to have especially during quarantine. but there is an issue. is anyone else experiencing this? it keeps crashing and it wont even let me open up the app anymore.	13
16-Apr-2020	i love tic tok. its such a great app that let's people show who they are. though i gave this 4 stars because its glitches alot. also takes up alot of space in my phone. but overall it's a awesome app~!	10
26-Mar-2020	atrocious app. kids everywhere spamming instead of working at school. tried it and the music seems to lag back. this also lags whatever video or movie your watching. i get the content on here but it's basically musically all over again	-4

27-Mar-2020	this app is amazing!!!!! from this app we can understand something so many things are there to learn also!!!! âœœand this app is for fun. if you use it in for right thing this is fantastic!!!!! but....... we have to use this in limit......	0
30-Mar-2020	this app is quite entertaining but i'm disappointed too. i always keep my profile updated and regularly post videos with various unique content, worst part is i don't even get 10 views on any video. i think i should stop using this app now.	-4
07-Apr-2020	this app is very good, i love it! it lets me share my creatons with other people. but this app scares you alot with the story times and stuff like that.	6
25-Mar-2020	this is a good social platform to share our videos... i like it ...ðÿ˜žðÿ˜žðÿ˜ž but my followers are not increasing...ðÿ˜ ðÿ˜ ðÿ˜ that is the problem please look to it because 5 to 6 people requested to follow me and i accepted the request but in my profile it's not showing...	6
19-Apr-2020	i really love it a lot but one thing it takes a lot of time to the lots of likes and right now for my likes i have 1116 so thats great the people who don't have much dont worry you will get some soon and thrust me you will but not a lot of likes like chariots and addson r that will take for ever but it depends how much you got so i hope you will get a lot like charil and addison and dixie,daisey ok sorry if i spell daisey wrong but get a lot of likes ok good luck everyone ðÿ˜šðÿ˜‰ðÿ˜†ðÿ˜„ðÿ˜ƒðÿ˜ðÿ˜€ðÿ˜‹ðÿ˜˜	20
22-Mar-2020	it is such an amazing app. ever since i started i feel like i can express myself freely. it is a great place to show your creativity and how you do. i recomend getting this app.	9
17-Apr-2020	i would give this app 5 stars, but i recently found out that only people with a large amount of followers are able to get the enhancement feature on their app. playing favorites?! ðÿ¤¨ðÿ§wow....complete bullshizzle. ðÿ¤¬	3

30-Mar-2020	it is so fun you can watch videos and even make some of your own... you can make a private accoint or even a public one over all it is just fun amazing you can make as may videos you want a day. another thing i like about tik tok is you can enecract and comment in the chat box below it can be disabled but most people dont really like it there is no limit to how many folowers or likes you can have or give...ðÿ‘‰ðÿ‘ˆ. you can go live also at anytime you want but you have to have atleast 1000 follow ðÿ˜‡	18
28-Apr-2020	it helps communicate with your friends cuz sometimes you wouldn't have their number so like it would help you communicate with them and you could get more friends off of it it's like an amazing app i love doing tik tok's on it almost every day and every day i feel like i'm having friends from everybody who is liking my post and everything so yeah i'm just so happy that i got on the for you page and that i'm helping other people get on the for u page	25
29-Mar-2020	it's really fun to do videos but i wish that the emojis of when your creating the video there would be the iphone emojis , and it can let you live with any type of fans you like . but it's an amazing app to use you learn more trends more music it's fun .	15
23-Mar-2020	i really love this app because it's a place for everyone and every genre. sad, happy, funny, serious or a mix of all. the comments can be a bit hateful sometimes, but creators have the option of turning comments off and filtering certain words they don't like so. . .i think it's a wonderful app. ðÿ‘œ	10
26-Mar-2020	it's a great way to create content and see creative people thrive! some times the algorithm can be a pain with hiding good content, but i still really enjoy making videos and exploring the app!	7
07-Apr-2020	when i've tried to create account and enter my birthday (i'm 21), a message pops up saying im not eligible for tiktok. tried to find solution, which was to clear cache, but that didn't work. please fix.	2
29-Mar-2020	i love this app, except figuring out certain edits like putting half song half original audio works... the was not much to explain on how to tiktok, but i enjoy what i can do! follow me at jinxalinxmeoww	8
28-Mar-2020	ok 2 things that i think would be cool. 1. being able to unlike multiple videos at a time. 2. being able to see how many videos you have liked. it just always bugs me so those are just a couple things i think would be cool.	0
06-Apr-2020	good app but the problem is in view. i live in bangladesh. why bangladesh is tiktok having problems with the views?bangladeh does not have much of a slow view. please fix it as soon as possible...	0
03-Apr-2020	this app is continuously violating notification settings and despite not being given permission for for popup notifications, it still goes ahead and shows pathetic notifications. i enjoy the content but i'll uninstall the app if this unruly behavior doesn't stop.	-2
16-Apr-2020	it's a great app, i haven't had any problems with it e x c e p t, i've seen a lot of hate. i know you can't do much, but maybe you could have bots patrolling the videos/comments? thanks, bye! ðÿ’•	4
20-Apr-2020	look i owned this app years ago. i've been trying to get rid of my old accounts it's just difficult cause i cant sign in. i've been bullied by my friends for things i did four years ago. many attempts have been made to get rid of my accounts i just cant sign in. it sucks .	-6
16-Apr-2020	honestly it's a lot of fun. the memes the glorious memes, comedy, creativity, cringe, horror, cosplay, quirkiness, and....dare i say it! even the furries are hours of entertainment! the duet feature is endlessly impressive some of the funniest/awesome things i've ever seen have come from it!	5
21-Apr-2020	amazing app and really funny, my account got suspended randomly for no reason at all and it was really annoying another annoying thing is that i have samsung and dont have all the apple's filters. can samsung users atleast have the greenscreen filter. it was very disappointing and if we unistall tik tok let us keep the drafts!	-9
13-Apr-2020	it's one of awasome app is userfreandly for every age groups. i used it from start lockdown day in nepal's. i think the app is good for entertainment, knowledge increase and refreshment. thank you entire team of tiktok for the amazing application i have new opportunity for explor my whole family member's extraordinary things. we all our family member, friends and relatives are support your team to reporting and suggestions for upgoing update and progress of tiktok. cheers ðÿ‘¨â€ðÿ‘¨â€ðÿ‘§ krishna bkt	18
05-Apr-2020	i really like to talk to others actually get the chance to talk to a celebrity.it's like so many different songs that i really like to listen to that i can make videos with my friends family also i really love it because it can be private it can be seen only by friends and the dj of the music is the bomb.and it is so entertaining to me i love the dancers that they make it's just so much fun and sometimes when something bad happens you know tiktok will make your day.what r u doing tiktok is hereâ™¥	17
31-Mar-2020	very entertaining and easy to use. like with most platforms, the algorithm can become unforgiving but as a creator you have to keep learning and adapting. great app in general. very stable on my s9. never had a single crash.	8
02-Apr-2020	like every other person over 30 i discovered this and then obsessed over it subjecting my significant other to hours of short audio clips and raucous bursts of laughter. i've calmed down now and look to it daily as a way to connect with other people's stories.	5
27-Mar-2020	i love it, it can be glitchy at times(maybe because of my internet im not sure lol) but it doesnt matter because you are still getting the full experience... and its great! :d it may not work for some people but it does work for me	4
29-Mar-2020	it works pretty well but sometimes it freezes up and closes out. this happened when i went to make a video and i lost the footage. that sucked but it's not a terrible app.	-5
04-Apr-2020	greatest app ever...i am soo addicted to this app i can spend the entire day on my phone just scrolling through it....en if someone says it's terrible they are sooooo wrong..... i would totally recommend for this app did i mention that it's also the best. keep up the great work you guysðÿ’–ðÿ’–ðÿ’–	5
20-Apr-2020	i make so many videos but you not a single video of mine viral. i have made many videos on tick talk. please request my tick talk, make my video viral, then i am happy with this app or else there is no use. i will uninstall it, support me, make my video viral, please i request you thanks ashish deran	7
17-Apr-2020	i spend so long on a video edit and when you cant trim the clips after adding to the song or edits it gets frustrating because you have to start all over. other than that love the app	1
16-Apr-2020	this app will use an large amount of data in the background. if you pay for mobile data, make sure to disable background data for the app.	-1
11-Apr-2020	i an addicted to this app! there is quality content on here u just have to keep scrolling! the only thing i would add to it is separate folders in your liked videos so when u go back its easier to find what video u are looking for!	4
15-Apr-2020	great app but the live videos should have better quality and load faster and not glitch often. also many audios aren't available in my region. please fix these issues for 5-stars.	5
21-Apr-2020	the app is brilliant ðÿ‘œ, but for the new user it's difficult to grow their accounts because it freezes cause of the overload and tiktok team who gives priority to old accounts.	2
15-Apr-2020	the new update with video notifications about a comment i liked is really annoying. most of the time it's a comment i didn't even like on a video i never seen. please remove it have an option that can block it. thanks for the entertaining app though	8
27-Apr-2020	problems :- 1. unable to apply online music 2. there is no way to find out who are online, like as likee app 3. some filters are not work properly 4. only high profile videos are being viral, what about small users?	3
19-Apr-2020	it is fun and i enjoy killing time with it but the position of the favorite botton changed so when i try to favorite a video i end up saying i'm not interested, but other than that i love the app even though i spend too much time on it.	10
23-Apr-2020	it has a nice variety on the for you page, but i was reccomended some really weird stuff, including videos of ignorant, transphobic people and people in general whose content consists solely of trying to harass other people, which i thought was a weird thing to condone/advertise	-4
18-Apr-2020	if you want to find the best app you have found it right here ðÿ˜‰ this is the best it's a obsessed app ðÿ˜‚ i got it on my birthday august i nearly uninstalled it glad it didn't ðÿ¤£ðÿ¤£best app ever!!!!!!!! i am loving this app everyday ðÿ˜ i make tiktoks with everyone and i can talk to my friend that moved schools on tiktok this is the best app i have installed!!!!!!!!my tiktok is : xanthieatkinson! i recommend you install this app don't need to pay at all or anything!!	22
15-Apr-2020	this app is honestly amazing. you can make videos of anything such as singing and dancing. this app is very creative and you can do a lot of things you can also find lots of people and watch their creations too!	2
15-Mar-2020	this app is awesome until it glitches or is stuck on you are tapping to fast. it is good though for a reminder to get off your phone and take a breather. is very addictive and is good in my opinion age 13+	8
20-May-2020	yes,i agree it is a fun app and has gave a great platform to many of the people with extra talent....but sometimes it is not acceptable..so it deserves only one starðÿ˜š	8
28-Mar-2020	this is a very bad app. i have followed their rules and regulations and there are 7000 fans on my tiktok id. 27,000 like hain yet the tiktok ones are not enabling me the option of live. i have sent them many times feedback on my id. i do not give them even i have mailed them, according to their rules, i should have got the option of live by now, but have not found it yet, so friends, i consider this app nonsense. if you make a slight error in the video, then you get a guideline immediately and s	-3
18-Apr-2020	this is a great fun app but the only problem that i am having and i also see other people having to is that the new beauty filter update didn't come out in some of people's tik tok so please explain this.	9
16-Apr-2020	everytime i use this app it freezes i used to think it was my phone but all my other apps work great its only this app i only rated it 2 stars because i love the content but the app is giving me real problems i am not happy about this please try and fix it	8
20-May-2020	app is fancy this app uses a lots of storage tiktok use lots of mobile data waste of time content recomend is not accepted and its very crinzy	0
24-Mar-2020	i only have two issues with this app. #1. is the the kids on this app choking each other and humping anything they can, and #2. peoples lives being shut down or banned for no reason, just because someone doesnt like their content and reports them. there should be a way to save your account from these people, they work way to hard to go live just to have a butt hurt idiot destroy that.	-10
16-Apr-2020	it's so addictive i really love this app and i also love how you can make videos. the only downfall to this app is that it is so addictive! you can do so much on this app and its full of memes, dances and trends. it's so fun!!	6
18-Apr-2020	really i love this app.... but i had a request to the developers. sir, i kindly requesting please add sound for the notifications from tiktok. it's may truly helps to know that someone is text to us or they follow. so if there is a sound for the notification it's help to replying the texted person on the time.	8
27-Mar-2020	absolutely love this app you can sit on it for hours just scrolling through all the videos and you can even have alot of fun making videos your self everyone has a chance to blow up so it's a extremely good app i've never experienced any problems so amzing!!!	10
05-Apr-2020	i like the idea of tiktok but the app is just horrible. i will comment in boyfriends videos and they don't show up. also my account doesn't show up when you search for it and i just made it like not long ago.	4
10-Apr-2020	it's amazing. there's absolutely no ads ever and it's very private so if your shy they will put you on a private account. it also asks you what you in treat are so when you look at videos it will be based on those stuff. definitely 1 million stars	-2
24-Mar-2020	tiktok is basically one of the best things that has ever happened to me! i am a painter for a living and i want my followers to see my progress on my projects, but hope well i do that? tiktok! it's all you need! you can add music, effects, stickers, and text on your video!	11
03-Apr-2020	it s a really good app it needs an update whenever i make a video it gets to 61 percent and it fails to upload and goes to my drafts and i try to upload it again and it does the exact same thing again	1
18-Mar-2020	this is such a good application you can just share what you have in mind you can chat with other people it is just such a good app you can post silly funny videos play really love it so you should definitely download this app if you're thinking about it the only thing is it says a couple cuss words here and there but it is really good	16
18-Apr-2020	i have all my permissions turned on but i keep getting a message that says i can't do a video until i turn on premissions. i uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still won't work.	0
15-Apr-2020	great for wasting time. when opening the app from a notification about a message, you can't get to the main page without reopening the app, minor inconvenience, but it gets annoying	-2
12-Apr-2020	can you guys change back the position of the favorites and not interested bottons. changing this seriously messes me up, and i don't have time to deal with my ocd about the change. please please consider having it go back to the way it was.	6
16-Mar-2020	very educational! this is a form of social media so it takes information about what you've searched and who you're following and offers things that are similar. you decide how you experience this app! enjoy!	0
25-Mar-2020	i love this app it really lets you have fun and there are so many fun diffrent things to do like dancing pov and just comedy and i really think it is a great app it can take your mind off of the bad things there are so many supportive people on there and there are so many people that can just make your day and i really think you should get this app	16
26-Mar-2020	great content lots of fun only thing i would like to maybe see change is adding a age requirement where we can be placed with our age groups children for children teens for teen and a 18+ for 18+ but other than yall are killing it...good looks	3
09-Apr-2020	good app to improve your acting skills and entertainment purpose. but, this app some times strucks and drafts will not open. my 5 draft videos are not opening, views are not coming, these are my huge problems in this app. without these, this app is very hood.	1
18-Apr-2020	it's a very good app in all the app which i have in my mobile ... ðÿ‘œ i like this app because this app has all videos which i like . like comedy , funny , emotional , romantic and so many...ðÿ‘œ âœ¨this app has been career for so many people. like team07, riyazaly , jannat zuber and so many âœ¨ ðÿ‘‰my id is also there on tik tok but i do not get many likes i have less like on tik tok so those ho all se my message so go on my id given below in this message and give me likes... ðÿ‘‰#@usernameremoved	22
05-Apr-2020	despite what many say about it, the app really is great. of course you will come across cringe but to be fair, every app has its ammount of cringe. i have found many of my favorite songs because of this app and its great to pass the time.	8
11-Apr-2020	tik tok is very very good applicationðÿ˜. i love this applicationðÿ˜˜. by this application we represent our talentðÿ˜ž. there are many application in our mobile phone but tik tok is the best application in our mobile phoneðÿ˜. in my home all members are seen tik tokðÿ‘¨â€ðÿ‘¨â€ðÿ‘¦â€ðÿ‘¦. my sister is biggest fan for riyaz ali and i am biggest fan for faisuðÿ’‹ðÿ’‹. i really love this application. thank you ðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜š	20

14-Apr-2020	it is a great app as long as you are 12 and up you can watch other people's videos but my tip would be to but it on a private account so only your freinds can see. you can make people's day with your vids. you can find life hacks which are great so i would 100% recommend it	8
18-Apr-2020	i would say that tiktok is a great app if your bored or in quarantine and it's also a wonderful app you can use when or if you are wanting to have fun or laugh this is the app for you i just wish i had more followers but overall it is great!	14
23-Apr-2020	it is a very entertaining app but one short problem is that if we post any video and then exit(the internet is working)then the video goes to the drafts which irritates me as we don't have to exit until and unless our video gets posted.please introduce a jew feature in which the video will get posted even if we exit out..	-3
16-Apr-2020	i love this aap. tik tok is a amazing app. but i have h problem with tik tok...i have problem with vedios views....... . hi tik tok team i have not receive my tik tok vedio vews. only 50 to 100 views.. why..... plz solve my problem... my tik tok id---@usernameremoved	2
18-Apr-2020	i like it, at first i didn't want to give it a shot, but then my girlfriend (now exâ˜¹ï¸) convinced me. i'm glad she did because now i'm obsessed with tiktok, it has so much good content, i just wish more people would see my profile, but i guess that part just might have to be luck ðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸. but overall it's definitely a 5 star app, i would've given it more but the limit is 5 :p	19
30-Apr-2020	i have this problem where it can't load any profile , including mine, and all i can do is scroll through the fyp and i can't find a solution in the faq section but the weird thing is it used to work first on the same phone before i reset it	-3

11-Apr-2020	sometimes to me it just makes if you're doing a filter it just makes face black i think that this shouldn't just be black i think it should be at least this thing the filter but if you don't make that way i don't know why you can't just let the filter be the filter but if it's just a glitch in it then i'm fine with that l but i glitches so you shouldn't make it like it should be the normal way i still do like it i really like it all other things are good you can see your cousins or other people	11
27-Mar-2020	this app is very entertaining and i like it a lot. it has every thing from funny skits to cool challenges and songs. i spend a lot of time on this app sending tik toks to my friends with it's messaging thing, lip sinking, and listening to my fav tik tokers! over all i rate tik tok a 5 out of 5!	9

30-Mar-2020	it's ok right now, but the filters are confusing to use without names or a way to search them. the videos can also come out blurry	-2
14-Apr-2020	omg it's like the best app ever and you can dance and sing it's just like you should get it and maybe you can get tik tok famous and you can use it in many languages so you can understand what the song says and you can make your account private which means if you follow someone and they follow you then they can see your videos and no one else can do that only if that happens more then one time and you can put your account public and that means any one can see your videos. now go get is app now	6
06-Apr-2020	it's a enjoyable app i just love it. but one thing that i think that should change is that when you text someone on there you need a phone number and i don't have a phone number and i want that rule you change	6
13-Apr-2020	it's a very good app i'm on it all the time it's very addictive though and it's not very healthy but it's an awesome app i have no problem using it. and you can also learn a lot on it (more about the virus,about nature etc...)	5
18-Apr-2020	love the app but i'm annoyed about how my private and public videos are all mixed together, not in a separate tab still, because it means i can't see what my account looks like to other people	0
28-Mar-2020	the app is great. when it works. it would say there was no internet connection even though i was connected to perfectly good wifi	5
10-Apr-2020	i love this app! the only reason i am givin it four stars is because everytime i go on tiktok at least me being on it for three mins it crashes and everything freezes. other than that its a good game.	6
21-Mar-2020	i love it and great music to match the video. hope this helps and i just watch it constantly when i'm borad. plus you get to watch other people to so cool dances and stupid things.	9
02-May-2020	i know its app is good it's fun to see what's other people doing outside but i have a problem related to my account i don't know its freezed or what, my videos couldn't get views 27/28 viewers reached on my every single videos it's too disappointing. i'm hopeless now.	4
20-Apr-2020	tiktok brings together music and editorial video and photo creativity. lots of fun editing tools and features. this app brings people together kids of all ages ðÿ¤£ so fun to watch the challenges and lots of laughs on here!	9
19-Mar-2020	tik tok is the best app ever there is nothing wrong with it the people who have a problem don't know what the hell they are talking about if you forget your password that isn't tiktoks fault it's your fault because they can't just give away a password not knowing if it's the person they say they are so i say and you don't have to agree but i think tiktok is the best app ever you can socialize and have so much fun at the same time so give it a go install tiktok you won't regret it believe me you'll love it i garanty it enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	5

28-Mar-2020	newest update has made the app unusable. the video freezes, but the audio continues even after closing it. have to go to my setting and force stop the app to make it quit replaying the audio. super annoying.	2
28-Mar-2020	i really like this app, though i think there are some things that could be approved upon. for example, it would be really cool if we could actually favorite videos to different folder, kind of like pinterest.	9
10-Apr-2020	it's very interesting, and helps a lot to people to showcase their inner talent, specially to the dancers and actors !! helps a lot to improve expression and dialogue delivery, i'm really glad to be a part of tiktok !!	9
12-Apr-2020	its great but be aware if you download it sometimes it tells you to free up space i delete some photos and come back hit post and it says the same thing and you cant do lives unless you have 1000 followers and it takes awhile to load but other than that it is great	7

14-Apr-2020	your app is really good but there are people on here that should not be on here and i think you should see what people text other people and be able to block them but any other way they're good cuz i've had some bad experience with people texting me saying bad things so just to look out if you download this app be careful cuz there are bad people out thereif i have some more looks and it can actually see what people are texting you and it will be better you should block them but if you are a kid	-1

28-Apr-2020	its is super awesome there are two things this app could change and add first with every video even if you follow them they should be able to still delete if because they posted something disturbing and second it sucks that you have to have 1.k or something like that to go live besides that it's a really good app	7
07-Apr-2020	every minute or so the app freezes, it's really annoyinn because it freezes when i'm in the middle of watching the video. the audio still plays, though. it's also super laggy	3
05-Apr-2020	i really like the app and the creative content that many users make my only issue and a lot of people would agree is the caption of the user and symbols all over the masek it hard to read captions in the video.	4

20-Apr-2020	have one major issue with the app is the duet option. although the video has been posted as a public video, my profile is also a public profile. yet the duet option goes off on its own. even after switching it on, it again goes off on its own. would appreciate if you'll could get this sorted.	2
28-Apr-2020	tiktok is a great app that's all i can say but i'm giving 4 stars because, recently i can't make a perfect video because the movement count not go well with the sound.	6
30-Mar-2020	it won't let me search sipe left and right or post it keeps logging me out then won't let me get back in til 1 minute but when i am logged out it will let me do everything that i can't do when i am logged in it's so anyoning	0
21-Apr-2020	its very easy to use and it also has even helped me learn how to dance a liitle bit. but i just wish getting followers where as easy as making the videos.	3
26-Mar-2020	first i downloaded it since my friend wanted me to follow him so he reaches 100k then it turned to be my 24/7. i should open it every day or else i am ganna go crazyðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚iy is really a great application i adore itâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸but there's a problem in the double tap for the likes since sometimes it works but other times it doesn't and it says that i'm tapping too fast and i should take a break. moreover, if i pressed the button of like it says the same and i can't put a like on any video	12
28-Mar-2020	it's lovely and beautiful funny app to make me most times laughing with too many comedy and funny videos from all different people and i find some new friends as well and anyone welcome to make friends with me as well...ðÿ˜˜ðÿœ¹	18
25-Mar-2020	i don't post, but some content creators complain of vids and even accounts getting deleted without reason. for me, just watching, it's great. features i'd like: ability to put my favorites in groups; ability to block hash tags - especially useful for political rants.	5
03-Apr-2020	this is the best app for entertainment nd showing our talents in front of others. it also allows many peoples to keep smile on their face it includes videos like humorous,hilarious ,romantic ,motivational,traditional nd so on .	7
24-Mar-2020	amazing app. â­ 4.5 stars. the editing is pretty bad because it doesn't save your timer. so if you do a bad take it's frustrating. the algorithm is perfect. recommends you the perfect videos.	5
30-Mar-2020	fun and very addicting but, as with all social media, you have to be ready for some negative people. cannot edit your comments or videos once posted but i really wish you could. ðÿ˜š	-1
04-Apr-2020	the biggest collection of the most unfunny and least creative content i've ever seen, you've seen the ads on youtube you know the low level quality content that exists on this platform, lip syncing a song is not funny its not creative it's lazy low hanging fruit this stuff is worse than vine and look how quick that died the only reason this is surviving is due to them sending so much on advertising let this platform die rid the internet of one form of cancer at least	-1
05-Apr-2020	this is an awesome app if your bored or have nothing to do it is a massive hit and i hope it will never die down even though there is hate there is still always some good vibes. this is one of the best ways to see your freinds during quarantine. 5/5 star i recommend	4
29-Mar-2020	i really like the app it's just sometimes when your recording something or importing another videos it glitches and makes me restart. other that that i really like this app!	4
11-Apr-2020	this app is very good but it doesn't show who viewed my profile in latest version 2020. i want to get who viewed my profile... please replace this as soon as possible.	5
12-May-2020	its very nice app i love this application for the first time in the morning and evening entertainment and the family are well known for its accuracy of the year of the year and a bit like a list, and a few days later on the way i can get it to be able to make sure you have any questions about the new year to you	8
31-Mar-2020	it's a wonderful app where u get to make videos and put ur own effects on them toðÿ˜„. it's a wonderful app to go when ur bored â™¥ï¸! tik tok features alot of great thingsðÿ’ž. i recommend this app to anyone who hasn't downloaded it yet, ( if ur age meets the requirements) 0~0ðÿ’žâ™¥ï¸ðÿ’—	11

27-Mar-2020	i used to like musical.ly better now adults are showing amd making videos that shouldn't even me on this app and there are kids on the app who see it and on musical.ly it was better i miss the old days when we made videos and get likes and on tik tok hardly anyone gets any likes anymore because they dont like it or something	6
19-Apr-2020	fun app, but i'm tired of getting notifications, even though i have notifications shut off. i reported the problem through the app. they asked for screenshots. i sent them. no response since.	-7
01-Apr-2020	awesome, fun & entertaining, fairly easy to use and interactive. only issue is a slight delay between the recording of the video and the music playback which gets irritating	4
06-Apr-2020	fun but some content gets taken down for certain reasons while others are still up with the same content or worse. i think rules should be a little more free or either the rules should be applied to everyone instead of just some	2
06-Apr-2020	this is a really good app and it helps when you are bored. i love the amazing content people post and the fun new dances that people come up with. i really recommend this app to mostly teens and adults as well.	18
08-Apr-2020	the app's somewhat easy to use. it seems like i'm missing a couple filters that other people are getting, but all in all its a good app. good for wasting time, making funny videos etc.	9
12-Apr-2020	i love this app! it keeps me occupied even when there is nothing else to do, and u could add friends and share videos! you could also use this app to express urself! i recommend this app to people who have nothing else to do or just want to do something fun!	7
15-Apr-2020	this is best musically app :- because there are so many and so nice effect and there i search sounds and also there are so many videos. so that's why this is best musically app. that's why i have give 5 star.	9
04-May-2020	fix the android app so it doesn't look like we're recording on a flip phone, then i'll give it five stars. you're out here embarrassing people who don't have an iphone because the quality looks so bad when in reality android camera quality is oftentimes better than iphones. fix the stigma please.	3
05-Apr-2020	app is so fun but when you sms a link to a person without an account(i think thats the reason anyway) it opens the app but doesnt bring them to the tiktok youve linked them to. super annoying and needs to be fixed!	5
07-Apr-2020	i love the app tik tok. it is inspiring, helpful, funny, and you can be you. most of the people on tik tok are very nice and kind and i will assure you that it is a great app. i hope you take my advice and download it 5 out of 5 stars most definitely.	13
19-Apr-2020	it is amazing. its alot of fun. its how i get rid of stress the dances you releive stress. i absolutly love it. theres a lot of funny content and a lot of nice people. me and all my friends have tik tok and we all give it 5 stars. its very child friendly.	8
15-Apr-2020	it is a good application for entertainment. but i need some changes in its feature, please add auto scrolling option in setting. so that we have not use our hand for scrolling.	4
16-Apr-2020	absolutely great. this app is a great way to spread positivity and to find like minded people. there are some absolutely amazing creators who are finally getting an outlet for their work.	12
16-Apr-2020	it's ok. it's just the filters when united states has lots of filters and start a bit trend the irish uk and others can't do it it's very sad to us tiktok please fix this otherwise it's a great app!	3
16-Apr-2020	i really like the app and i enjoyed that you have your own privacy but whenever someone follows you and you go on inbox it says they have messaged you but actually they haven't!?!	7
20-Apr-2020	it's great! i would love to see a reduction in bullying and the new stitch feature is just horrible. other than that i love it! all difrent kinds on content and groups!	4
19-Apr-2020	okay at first but now very slow in loading and moving between screens until eventually the app crashes. after two or three of these the app just crashes on opening over and over until you have to delete and reinstall.	0
22-Apr-2020	ok so i have nothing against the app. but a lot of people haven't been able to get on their account"for being to young" yes tiktok is mostly filled with teens but i think people shouldn't get kicked off just because of age. most if the time it's teens who are hurtful making fun of the younger kids and older people. its not the best situation. i myself am "old enough" for this app. im 14 but i think 12 and under should also have the right since their accounts are monitored by their parents.	8
19-Apr-2020	it's a good app but it keeps taking down my video of me singing saying that the copyright owner hasn't made it available in my country. and it happens the second its uploaded. very frustrating. please fix	4
24-Apr-2020	hi.... i love this app and i am very active on it too.. but the problem is that i don't get many views on my video.. i see video with no creativity getting millions of views... its shocking nd troubling too... plss resolve the problem... i love tiktok and want more views on my videos.... pls pls pls help.ðÿ™œ my acount b_e_t_u	1
23-Mar-2020	best app ever but very adictive! i personally recommend it for all ages above 10, because of the swearing and 15 year old girls shaking their asses ,but still it's an amazing app.	4
24-Mar-2020	it's a good app but whenever i try to search up something or whenever i leave the app it logs me out and when i search up something it kicks me out of the app and then logs me out. i'm on android 1 so please fix this	3
25-Apr-2020	this is like my favorite app . i'm on it 24/7. great work but.. can you guys change it back to musically ? everybody was on musically, nowadays, people is always on instagram because y'all changed musically to tiktok . and i know all y'all did was change the name but still ... people is kinda weird .. so if you guys want more people on the app . cause i was almost to 500 until y'all changed it , my account got deleted and i had to make a new one . then i advise you guys to change the name back .	9
11-Apr-2020	tik tok is amazing i would give it a five out of five but i gave it a four because some of the videos have swear words and some people post inappropriate content but you get to choose what you want to see at the beginning but overall i am addicted and love this app	4
17-Apr-2020	the app used to be fun but now i'm only a couple months "to young" to do anything, no livestreams until 16 is understandable but what is the only way to contact somebody is tiktok and you cant because all of a sudden that's 16 plus now to, its bs and all of this needs to be reversed before people really start hating the app. just a tip because musically would never do this.	-2
15-Apr-2020	fun and boring at same time. can stay in contact with friends who have the app to. very fun to make videos when bored. time consuming but worth it. thank you,	9

03-Apr-2020	it's a really fun and great app but the "your tapping to fast" and the "your following to fast" things are sooooo annoying. i'm just trying to show other creators support but i get stopped all the time. otherwise it's soooo fun and awesomeeeee	12
19-Apr-2020	amazing app to connect people around the world.. we can learn, teach, show our talent, laugh, get motivated etc. etc. there's lots of things to do with tiktok.. thumbs up ðÿ‘ðÿ‘	2
20-Apr-2020	it's aite but seems to work better for iphones in terms of the voice over command which has to be done after recording d actual video if using androids. .. other than that it's a great app	5
25-Apr-2020	hye i love this app nd i am always active on it but the problem is i don't get views on my videos. on my 1 videos i get only 25 to 40 views nd 15 to 10 likes in one video... i see others video with no beauty or no creativity they get millions likes...i was shocked nd troubling to. that means there is no value of talent or creativity.anyway plzz solve my problems plzz i love tiktok nd i don't want to get uninstall this app because of this stupid problems plzz solve it plzz my id @usernameremoved	4

21-Apr-2020	app is cool to watch videos on but changing the app permissions behind my back is unacceptable. i disabled notifications at the app level in settings just to find out they were re-enabled later. that's a red flag. uninstalling	1
20-Apr-2020	i don't like that the fact that i cant use alot of filters for example the green screen its really annoying and there is many more filters that i cant use and i would really appreciate if i could use it	2
17-Apr-2020	functions well, but their algorithm is wack. suppresses content made by "ugly", fat, or disabled creators as well as lgbt content (trans men more frequently now). it's almost perfect except for that.	3
03-May-2020	okay so everytime i try upload a video it gets stuck on 61% and im sooo annoyed ive cleares cache and data which deleted all my drafts obviously but it still isnt fixed i honestly dont know ive turned my internet on and off to but it doesnt work !!!	-4
09-Apr-2020	this app is very good but one problem i have is that some of the features are not available onmy phone and i have a samsung s10 but only my friends with iphones have the features i dont have even though some of the phones are older than mine. please fix this	2
29-Mar-2020	i love this app so much i use it all the time it's so much fun watching you favourite tiktokers and making your own videos and dances you can also post pictures on there that i love it works best on a phone bec tablet or ipad is laggy and it doesn't work on any other device other than that it's an amazing app	19
04-Apr-2020	this is very nice app and helps others to move forword with their talents... but in my phone there is no updating options please provide for my phone options like double exposure... and photo templets also..	7
11-Apr-2020	this app is not just a fun app for phone it is a way through which u can showcase ur talent to the world....it is a big platform and i love this app...by which i am sharing my life but the problem is videos dont get viral and such efforts are needed to make videos which all is waste if ur video dont gwt viral please make videos viralâ™¥ï¸	8
03-Apr-2020	i've had tiktok quite alot of times i've deleted it once then got it back but when i press open the app it opens to the loading bit then says it has stopped and i'm not sure why? i love this app but please get it to work! :)	8
06-Apr-2020	it is very good app. ðÿ˜ðÿ¥° but, if you have a low like then, it is not âœðÿš«good for youðÿ˜¡ðÿ˜¡ . this app is good for only famous people, not âœðÿš«for you and me. i am also suffering like this. pleaseðÿ˜«ðÿ™ðÿ™ðÿ’“ like lower liker video also not think that, it is not good for me. those people are thinking like this, they are lazy people, selfish, they think only about them only.ðÿ˜¡ðÿ˜¡ðÿ™.	16
15-Apr-2020	fun app but the amount of pet effects 10 cat 3 dog. from the dog fx one is christmas another is a princess crown. if you have a male dog this leaves you with 1 fx 11 months out of the year. a few more dog fxs would be awesome.	0
12-Apr-2020	very fun app, lots of choices, share your thoughts with people, made new friends! would reccomend any social media star or people who want to make videos and share with the world!	7
22-Apr-2020	i love this app...but this is a bad review. i have 3 accouts, however i can only use my dm's on one because im used my phone number on that one and it wont let me do it again. i would deeply appreciate it if you fix this and had dm's open on all accouts. thank you.	4
16-Apr-2020	needs labels on filters and editing instead of just pictures. faster updates for android would be swell. also a better way to upload sounds, and keep or give credit. all in all not horrid and pretty entertaining once it grows on you.	2
29-Apr-2020	this app is very cool.you can chat with famous people and follow other people and in return they can follow you back.people like will smith, the rock, kevin hart, anthony anderson, tracee ellie ross and the tiktoker with the most followers.....charli d'amelio. it will also keep you busy during this lockdown	4
31-Mar-2020	tik tok is more to me than just another app. it has helped me better my life, helped me build friendships, and helped me get through some very tough times in my life. thank you tik tok, i am forever grateful for this app, and i will continue to use it and recommend my family and friends to download it!	9
04-Apr-2020	this app is a fun and exiting way to watch what other people have made and you can be creative to make a video, which you can make private, make it only for friends to see or make public.	6
05-Apr-2020	i love this app so much i spent most of my time on it. i love it because you can make what ever content you like but it i not really fair when someone dose something stupid or nothing at all and they get so much clout wile other people are working hard and don't get any clout.	7
21-Apr-2020	best app. i love this app and i post my videos every day , i'm very active on it. but the main problem is that i don't get views on my videos. plzz tiktok solve my problem. i like tik tok. i wanna more views on my videos. plz plz plz tiktok help me...	5
22-Mar-2020	tick tok is really fun. tick tok will let you do effects filters and more fun stuff in your videos. this is a really good app it keeps us safe. but tick tok can be slow and glitchy sometimes. but tick tok is a good app and a fun safe app.	20
23-Mar-2020	i love the app, it's very social and i love the fact that you dont always have to leave your account to log into another account, the thing that i dont like about that is that you can only have 3 accounts	3
29-Mar-2020	pretty good except that with my phone i cant use the green screen filter. maybe try and fix that please? other than that its pretty awesome.	8
30-Mar-2020	i absolutely love tiktok!! i just wished that tiktok would verify people's accounts so it wouldn't have a problem with fake accounts and we wouldn't have a problem with sex offenders on the accounts why people that harass people...it would surely be nice if those things were taken care of!! and there's a lot of nudity... but of tick tock made a 18 and older account for the wild ones? personally i feel that tik tok needs to be more aware of things to make it a safe environment for all..	2
10-Apr-2020	amazing and functional. it is a funny yet social platform where children make/watch content. amazing quality and welcoming/tutorial. thanks for reading this.	16
14-Apr-2020	honestly it's an amazing app! i am addicted and have been! i k ow it's rlly late to write this review, but anyway..... i thi k it would be cool if tiktok added a part to add to "ur story" like snapchat or instagram, it would be rlly cool! and i thi k they should let u go live with however many followers u have, not just 1000,bht overall an amazing app :)	14
15-Apr-2020	it's a revamped vine. a few downsides to it is that if you have an android you can use the green screen effect and also if the app developers think you're ugly or poor looking they wont promote your videos.	-4
02-Apr-2020	i love to talk that so i the only app i may say i am when i'm on my phone and i was that at very much and i'd waited a 5 had made a problem 100 stars i just hope i can get up to a 1000 follows so i like a man you people who are going to get to talk to get it it's fun	5
31-Mar-2020	i have had this app for about a year and i love it it's so fun and you can be your self. it allows you to block people and has amazing privacy settings, and there are a huge variety of songs and trends to use in your video.	11

12-Apr-2020	it's a fun and safe way to express your feelings! you can go in slow mode, or fast mode. it's a fun game and i have no questions that it's a 5 star game	8
06-Apr-2020	it's so fun to learn new dances and to laugh at the funny content that people make. you can watch videos that your friends make,make videos with your friends and i just love this app.	12
15-Apr-2020	it's super fun but h wishyiu didnt need 1000 followers to go live cause i only have 100 but it's really fun makeing videos but you should ban all gacha heat videos theres to much and it's wrong if you go on gacha life it says agree if you will not make any bad videos but theres so meny i would like it if you banned all of these gacha heat videos but all the other jets fun getting fans cause of your hard work that you guys did to make it fun! keep up the great work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	15
15-Apr-2020	one of my favourite apps to use... the only thing i dislike about it is normally you get notifications from the inbox but it doesn't notify me right away maybe a few hours after the fact	0
12-Apr-2020	love the app!! it cures bordem, you can find your friends on the app, you can see many weird but cool things, and out of all the time i have been on this app, i've been in one argument and i've seen one mean thing xd highly recommend	-1
16-Apr-2020	it's very fast to move within the app, gives opportunity for the regular person to shine, share their experiences (fast track of their successes n failures shares), easy apps found within to enhance individual video, more & better streamline of tik tok content you want to keep & to throw out, & non compliant tik tok content removed, even platform with the rich n the famous, i.e. its not about them only, -ve content blocked, easy unlimited fyp shares ok end here thank you! keep evolving tik tokðÿ‘œ	12
10-May-2020	this app is good. i am very active on it too... but the problem is that i post daily vedio, i don't get many views on my vedio. i do a lots of hard work but after somedays my profile directly went go down. i send many msg on tiktok app but my problem not resolved... please tiktok team resolve my problem, growth my per vedio views and id(@usernameremoved)	1
15-Apr-2020	i'm obsessed, i can sit for hrs and watch videos all day ! iv herd of this app years ago and thought is was for musicians! ðÿ¤·ðÿ¼â€â™€ï¸ till a friend told me it's not like what i thought! love it!	6
26-Apr-2020	please turn it back yo musical.ly i miss it sooooo much it was more family friendly and most of my childhood was that app and i miss it alot it was when there was no "f boys" and "clout chasers" it was the good old days when we could get crowned instead of verifyed and i miss the vines like vines were life and most of the ogs quit tik tok beacause they think its dangerous and not friendly and that musical.ly was so much more friendly, i just suggest musical.ly to come back it was amazing..bye!	1
01-May-2020	deleted this app at the news that corporate was telling its mods to shut down videos made by the unattractive and disabled. reinstalled it recently in hopes that this was no longer happening and for some of the funnier content. disappointed that you can, as far as i can tell, no longer merge audio with a video you've dueted. tried to make a video of me singing with myself and the voice-over feature just doesn't work the same.	0
01-Apr-2020	i don't like that you can be "following to fast", or "liking to fast". but other than that its a great and fun app.	9
02-Apr-2020	it does not have many features. like i still don't have the beauty or the glitch filter. i don't know it's the new updated version yet i'm unable to access most of the filters . it sucks	3
30-Apr-2020	i think it was a wrong idea to get rid of messaging if you're under 16. most people who were texting weren't talking about anything inappropriate, like me and my friends. please bring this feature back.	1
25-Mar-2020	it is a very fun and inspirational app with pros and cons. one pro is when you can make fun videos a con is when your videos only get five likes. other than that it is a very fun app.	14
25-Mar-2020	this app is really good and i have this app for really long time(when it was musically)but i want to change my name and i can't type the new name (i was waiting 30 days at first)	4
18-Apr-2020	i had an idea for the favorite list. i have a lot of liked videos and so i'm using favorites i think we could have folder's of our favorites like we could name the folder and put videos in there. example: folder name is animals so i would put all of my favorite videos of animals. just an idea	12
23-Mar-2020	good app to watch others make videos, though absolutely terrible camera quality when it comes to the galaxy note 10. i wouldn't even attempt to make any due to how bad it is.	-4
15-Apr-2020	tik tok is a very nice app i love but my. videos are slowing down and i thank you guys for making tik tok all my siblings are on tik tok because it is wonderful. my family likes it so much please help me get better quality of the videos and have been trying and trying to figure out if i can get a better quality so my phone will be working properly ,the owner of this is the best â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸ i love him he's the real 2020 president candidate, i will see if you already helped me, i love you allðÿ˜ðÿ˜ðÿ˜ðÿ˜	32
02-Apr-2020	having problem with the network connections my internet works fine but after a few min it keeps saying no networking connection and i have to unstail and redownload again i done it 5 time need to be fix like come on now nothing wrong with my network till it get fix i leave it work 2 stars	-4
27-Mar-2020	finally going to spend more time on this app with my new samsung tmobile smartphone. looking forward to pushing my creativity with this app. like any other social media app > it is as powerful of a messaging tool as snap once was. this is supposed to be the brilliant remedy. #hurricaneari	8
08-Apr-2020	i loved this app like you get to show your true colours and it's just amazing. no body will judge you at all. it's a place to show who you really are you don't have to hide it x	5
17-Apr-2020	watching them is great. but most effects are "not avaliable on my device" such as clone trio and green screen. why?? i haven't got an old or basic phone. i have a huawei that has the lastest updates.	6
19-Apr-2020	obviously it's the best! um..but could you probably put a fixture where we could add multiple sounds at the same time..or better multiple effects	2
06-Apr-2020	really hate the logo. the design is like looking at something that's made for 3d. so it looks messed up without the glasses.	-3
25-Apr-2020	i really enjoy most of the videos, but the algorithm is messed up. since of the most popular videos are just cute boys during there, while people like me have made hundreds of videos and worked really hard on our content.	6
06-Apr-2020	what i think to talk is a wait at because um i got to make videos and people get to like them and i get to talk famous and it goes all over the world and i like that so i can get more likes and followers and i'm happy with the app because i have a lot of likes and followers and it's very entertaining	13
11-Apr-2020	i love it, i download it as a joke but instead i got really obsessed with tik tok and i can't get off of it, i usually spend my whole entire day what i mean by whole entire day i mean whole entire day having whole entire day i mean like for two days straight actually, so if you want to dance go ahead it's amazing.ðÿ’–ðÿ’–	11
08-Apr-2020	i like the fact that you promote newbies videos to people who they aren't followed by. that's what i really like, and without that i won't be getting no views and followers. thanks a lot! ~love	6
14-Apr-2020	i like this app but i want musical.ly back. some off the challenges and trends that are becoming popular were literally just normal musical.ly videos and i just feel like musical.ly was better.	8
15-Apr-2020	it's overall a good app, pretty intuitive to use. however, making tiktoks is not intuitive at all, and could profit from a better ux.	8
23-Mar-2020	i love it!!! it help me find my childhood bff!! i live the fact that people are open and that u get on the fyp easliy!!! its really great to know that there's other ppl in the world who can help and that the recording stuff is really easy to manage	11
21-Apr-2020	overall the app is great i love it. the only problem is when you are searching for a song it does not come up. still great though!	7
21-Apr-2020	explended awesome site to be on am like wow what a apk so cool the only thing keeps me going these days when i realy feel like i can. just pick up my phone and go on tik tok first thing even in the mornings sometimes it makes me does nothing all the time spend on tik tok and not knowing and just alway amused	13
01-Apr-2020	its an amazing app one thing i would like to add is for the timer you have to put in the time when it ends i wish there were arrows to go back and forth between the time eg. â¬…ï¸ 14.6 âž¡ï¸	7
06-Apr-2020	it's a great app for beginners. it becomes the first step towards the acting field. people get to know their expressions, their actions... etc best app... hats off to the developers... thank you	8
05-Apr-2020	very fun and addicting there is nothing i would change. if there is a bug it almost always fixed immediately. very fun to pass time with all the new trends and dances to learn. i highly recommend	8
10-Apr-2020	i love it. my kids love it. we enjoy watching short funny videos that make us laugh, do it yourselves, and those that make us see things through new eyes...	12
10-Apr-2020	i love the app. unfortunately when i go to watch ppls lives my messages stop being shown to the host and i constantly have to go in and out. it's really annoying and makes the app hard to enjoy.	-1
13-Apr-2020	this is my first post in tik tok. but seriously this a awesome app all over the platform. because original platform is like to all people for the first time.	6
06-Apr-2020	it is very nice app i have ever seen in my life and i really give it 5 stars ðÿœÿ with my heart. û”. û”. please can you add the feature where we can add it our own music in ofline mode every thing we need is in this app. love it	7

20-Apr-2020	this is a great app and i had it for 4 years now and it's great my brother downloaded it and my dad did too but it does have cursing in it and if u do something bad you will get band or a video talked down like my cousin but have fun with tiktok and have fun creating your videos	13
02-May-2020	i lv dis app but i hve some problems using the app as i m very active in it but i dnt get many views on my videos i get one 10-20 views on my videos.even after posting the problems with the tiktok team in the app my problem is not solved..please resolved the problems.i love tiktok nd i want more like views on my videos..plz help..my tiktok id-@usernameremoved	1
21-May-2020	this app doesn't deserve even 1star because this app is soo biased and not programmed well because so many people with good talent won't get good number of followers and likes where as many people with unnecessary stuf and ugly looks(not only looks but with zero efforts & talent) will get great following number. when it is not giving lime light to talented people and making ugly guys celebrities and also it consumes data like water.so i feel it is waste of time and our valuable mobile data.	10
11-Apr-2020	yes!yes!yes! love this app! some times it glitches but, just put in in ã—2 and they won't know it's in faster mode!pls download this app and follow me my username is hey_itsyourgurl. thanks bye!!ðÿ’žðÿ©	5

09-Apr-2020	it the best app for videos comdy and sometimes the new updates don't really work and i think they should actually like make it work on androids cos i give what's an iphone people's and others. not working like my android phone	7

07-Apr-2020	it has so many functions, filters, effects to play with. is an app that challenge you to interact, so i think it is very entertaining	-1

23-Mar-2020	i love this app it is amazing! i do recomend starting off with a private account and once you get used to the editing and other features then switch to a public account and gain tons of followers!	5
07-Apr-2020	really fun app just needs to be more user friendly where we know how to use features rather than have to google it or youtube instructions on it. otherwise, it's pretty fun and engaging!	11
11-Apr-2020	love it and fun. just wish there was a way to kinda choose what content to choose from. some language is a bit much and would like to bypass those as i like to do fun dances and thing with my children. ðÿ¤·ðÿ½â€â™€ï¸	13

28-Mar-2020	i love this app with all the filters, music, and insporational people! i rated it 5 stars! but the only down side is that people post innapropriate videos and there are little kids on that app and they dont need to see that	3
10-Apr-2020	the new position for the follow button is kinda weird...i've accidentally pressed it way too many times when i scroll. i kinda liked it on the side as the cross (+)	0

16-Apr-2020	would've given 5 starts before today. for some reason, the audio and video doesn't match up. seems like theres some kind of lag. not experiencing this on any other apps	2
22-Apr-2020	love this app! but the lack of support for android is why i give it â­â­.the camera is not optimized to android cameras so it looks horrible on my normally beautiful photos. along with the fact i am running android 10 and have dark mode on why is there no dark mode tik tok on android but there is on ios!!!	-3
26-Apr-2020	tik tok is a good stage to show our talent it is a good app but sometimes it gets stopped ,not responding . this app has good quality . i am recommending all to instal this app . tik tok lite is also nice but not as tik tok i am kindly saying that this app is very safe too . we can easily find our favorite film stars this app has good quality filters and sounds sometimes videos not get saved i am very sad about it if this all promblem is removed it will be really a nice app	26
18-May-2020	not getting views after uploading quality videos even tried so many techniqes to increase views on my videos , i think my account has been freeze which is not working for me. totally unsatisfied.	3

26-Apr-2020	update still not much to say about this app but i have put my star rating lower becuase it seems like the are losing their touch as well as alot of young children alot are grown up enough to know what humor and the arts is about but some of them shouldn't be allowed on this app but the app its self hasn't given me issues which is rare in my case but also seeing year old posts , and with the creators new "cellphone" coming out it might not be as well maintained during that time. losing intrest	-2
22-Apr-2020	it was a really fun app, but it keeps crashing my device, and then i have to give it a hard reset, which wipes the entire device, and that kind of sucks. also the fact that it won't let me see my notifications is pretty bad as well. please fix this.	2
16-Apr-2020	i love this app yes it can be addicting but the people are so supportive. but the only thing is that if u have over 1k followers u should be able to go live if u are older than 10 because i have 10.9k followers and i am banned from going live.but this is an amazing app and very addictive so get ut at ur own risk.	6
28-Mar-2020	i love this app and i'm always on it but recently i've been having trouble. so when i tag my friend in a video it wont show up but if she tags me in one or i respond to hers it shows up and i'm not sure why.	4

29-Mar-2020	i found a lot of fun in this application this is a very enjoyable application in play store for social networking site all options are working properly sometimes found a problem which network issue but all over it's good.	4
04-Apr-2020	content is dull, repetitive and full of staged 'amazing moments'. a huge number of videos are click bait to get you to like a page. the advertising team for tiktok is absolutely terrible as well. avoid.	0
26-Apr-2020	i give this app 4.5 but it won't let me do it but anyways i love this app and have been on it for many many years and it's a rally grate app the only problem is that on some devices you can't have certain features like on lg you can't have green screen but other than that this app is amazing	4
18-Apr-2020	i love this app it is so amazing it is so nice to see what people are posting mabey the only thing that you could change is putting more songs on there. other than that i love itðÿ˜.	13
19-Apr-2020	it's a great app it's just the beauty filter didn't have an effect what so ever and some of the filters on there are just really low quality other than that it's a awesome app	12
03-May-2020	in the beginning this app works so fast no any network problem but now out of 24 hours it works just for 2-3 hours . there is full network connection but it doesn't go on it irritates alot ðÿ˜‘	-7
22-Mar-2020	so fun! you get to create fun videos and show off some of your talents! you also get to see other people's funny and talented video creations!	12
01-Apr-2020	it is an amazing app for people if all ages (most of the time hehe) to post on. except the facts that maybe tiktok could have some sort of blocked iist with your can view who you have blocked (i don't know if they have this already) but its just a suggestion!	2
18-Apr-2020	it's amazing you make videos watch videos and even like and follow and if you do not want to sign in you can double tap the screen fast for a heart which is a like.	9
24-Apr-2020	i love this app its helped me out of my confer zone and helped me know that there are lots of funny people in the word. i'm just speechless do this app it's the best but my favourite thing about tik tok is that i can make vids and people can wathch them and like follow or even answer my poles it's the most amazing app really suggest that people who has depression or just in a confer zone should get this app. hope u get this app ðÿ’–ðÿ’žðÿ’–ðÿ’žðÿ’œ	20
07-Apr-2020	good app, but the glitches are mad and the amount of times your work is taken down for no reason is a bit much.	-4
11-Apr-2020	this app is really cool and i love how you can watch people do funny and crazy stuff. i also like how you can like over videos and follow other tik rockers like me. so go download this app if you haven't allready.	12
21-Mar-2020	expect messaging in this app... other things are ok ok . tik tok has the worst messaging option .other than this it is good but still there should be more improvement in this application ðÿ‘ if about privacy and all it is awesome .thank you	6
20-Mar-2020	entertainment at its finest! short videos for short attention spans, cute doggos, spectacular scenery, funny short videos, make up vids, you can make your own really easily 10/10 would suggest and enjoy this app.	8
11-Apr-2020	welcome to grammar check! you may start with the following example: no matter how many mistakes you make, you are still ahead of those who never try. just give it your best shot. enjoy mistake-free writing now!	2
22-Mar-2020	it's a good app there's no bugs or glitches but there is a lot of homophobic, sexist and racist content on the app but generally the rest of the content is good.	0
18-Apr-2020	i love this app. its entertaining and makes me happy especially this time that we are facing the pandemic problem. i have only one question.. what is wrong to like fast with my friends video? admin barred my likesðÿ˜¢ðÿ˜¢ðÿ˜¢ðÿ˜¢	13
17-Apr-2020	i like the endless chain of videos on the app. i wish there was a "play from beginning" option for some of the longer videos.	3
27-Mar-2020	perfect! i'm giving it 5 stars cause it's really easy. but it dies include payments. you need to buy coins to give stuff to people in there live streams but although it is really good i recommend it.	5
30-Mar-2020	this is an awesome app that let's you make videos to express yourself the way you are and you can be weird and funny but it wont matter just be yourself and its really fun,cool, and amazing!!â¤	7

30-Mar-2020	it's an awesome app but only one thing i kinda dont like about it. it changed my life and gave me a lot of negativity. but from what i've been doing for the past two years i really like it so thank you.	6
25-Apr-2020	i do enjoy the app and its content most of the time but my app never updates, like ever. i have another account which is more like my side account that has all of the updates but my main account doesn't. if you could fix this issue please	6
07-Apr-2020	tiktok is a fun and addicting app which is what i love about it but i would say if there was an auto scroll feature it would be even better for everybody that is busy using their hands, an auto scroll feature would help alot	11
07-Apr-2020	i love it this is so much fun some videos make me laugh and cry and happy it's just so cool i make so many videos on tiktok but there is one problem that is the music is good but i doesn't do the whole song or most of it.â¤â¤â¤ðÿ’–	12
13-Apr-2020	this app has made me laugh it has helped me through my dark days and understands what i like not showing me just not funny stuff this is the best app i have on my phone and trust me i have a lot thank you for making this app.	13

29-Apr-2020	this game is the best eye makeup videos all the time but there is a little boomer when i first joined to talk i try to like look at everybody's comments in like i can't follow anybody and stuff like that and it it would say that i have i couldn't post a video so i really don't like that	11
16-Mar-2020	this is a fantastic app but the problem is that when i like the videos it keeps on showing " u r typing too fast take a break ..."i think it must be improved ðÿ˜’ðÿ˜’	6
26-Mar-2020	it's ok but i dont like the ad videos it's so annoying. cause it says play game but i cant play it. really and it's annoying how people are posting scroll like follow share videos there using legends	-3
23-Apr-2020	it's amazing to express your true self but it's people like hate pages and fan pages going against each other gacha heat pages and the fact you have to have at least 1000 followers to go live and i don't think that's fair.other than that it's a really fun app.	12
24-Mar-2020	the first time i got this app is really good but then it suspended my account and then i couldn't get back in and then i got a new account and it wouldn't let me find friends had people like while i was growing through the for you page nothing you wouldn't let me do anything	5
27-Mar-2020	nice app and all but bruh... let people cut video clip recordings during the editing process and esp allow all the effects to be applicable when posting post-saved videos from our gallery. it's much more accessible rather than having us do the hassle to make what we want	1
27-Mar-2020	am i the only one who's not ok with the downloaded videos being saved in my camera folder? i don't like to have them mixed with my photos. i looked all over the internet but i didn't find anything. please change that trough an update! thanks	8
15-Apr-2020	the weird algorithm that puts certain videos on the for you page instead of others as well as the content that gets flagged as opposed to stuff that doesn't is the reason this app will never receive 5 stars from me	-1
15-Apr-2020	love it you can pick if you want a private or public account and if people want to follow you they can not see your videos and they send you a follow request. if you get 1000 followers you can go live...	2
06-Apr-2020	some filters don't work on android that's a bit annoying. another thing is that it keeps crashing when i'm choosing cover. other than that i love tiktok!	3
29-Mar-2020	it's really very awesome ðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜šit is open platform to us. we show our talent by the tik tok . mostly people use it because everyone easily make their videos and we are never feel bore because we have tik tok app thank you tik tok i love it ðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜š	9
03-Apr-2020	from few days the videos i record are getting chopped a few secs in the starting when i download. bt i can see the full video on tiktok app. i don't understand whats the problem. i alrdy uninstalled and reinstalled the app too	0
27-Mar-2020	i love tiktok it's a great app, naver had many problems with it. some times videos take a while to load all though that could be my internet but mostly a great app.	7
20-Apr-2020	its great! buttt an issue is that there are to many hackers that are hacking into other accounts! it's not right. so i suggest that they should fix it.	0
28-Mar-2020	this app never works for me. i have done every possible thing but it constantly says no network connection despite being connected and all other apps working with no issue. so frustrating.	-2
18-Apr-2020	fun and very entertaining. i like it so much i signed in and i'm gonna try this! lol! tho i won't get many followers and likes but doesn't matter is it just for fun! ðÿ˜‚ðÿ¤£ðÿ‘‰ðÿ‘ˆðÿ¤žðÿ‘	5
21-Apr-2020	i'm honestly having a lot of fun, but they need to do away with the stitch feature, it's pretty much just stealing peoples videos.	-1
19-Mar-2020	this app is fun not gonna lie but lately it won't alow me to use green screen well it does but like the pictures won't show up and it's getting very frustrating and it use to be fine it the anyways u can fix this	6
16-Apr-2020	tiktok is one of the greatest applications i have ever used. it is very user friendly and i consider it as one of the best social media application.but my account @usernameremoved was temporarily suspended without any proper reason.it is clear that this move is an act of personal revenge.so i kindly request take this matter seriously and let it not happen again. i hope my problems will be resolved. @usernameremoved	9
13-Apr-2020	video not working after uploading and app having crashing issue , lagging , proper content posted are getting stopped by error as could not play video amore mio is my username but i am unable to send feedback ðÿ˜” tik tok team must revert back with helpful feedback still app is crashing on nokia 7.2	-5
27-Mar-2020	it would be 5 star but on my s10 i am unable to use the green screen feature and it makes it harder for me to keep up with trends on this app.hope you could add this feature to the s10 in the future.	-2
14-Apr-2020	i am getting problems on my tik tok account , firstly i am not getting views, secondly if am uploading my video , it was not seen in any other device , please help me , i cannot understood what is the issue behind this	1
02-Apr-2020	i enjoy this app and most of the creators that use it. unfortunately, i am unsure of the apps staff. recently two creators have come underfire because of sexual harrassment and pedophilia accusations. rather than taking action against these two creators, tik tok has decided to ban and silence those speaking out against them. ultimately i would just like for this app to have a healthier environment for everyone who uses it.	1
01-Apr-2020	i am fine they use songs, but here's the problem, they don't credit the artists. they just take songs they think is good like heathers. plus, they ruined the fork in the garbage disposal meme for me. please just credit the artists for the songs they use.	5
24-Mar-2020	i give it three stars because its honestly a good app but i dont support at all the boosting up people who say the n word on the app and putting down the people who don't! i swear once again that is not shining on true talent. this app otherwise has a good overall theme but needs to work on the love.	9
08-Apr-2020	it's super fun and i can make a lot of nice and bad videos but sometimes i don't like the policy sometimes but it is better than musically and it's way more fun	15
13-Apr-2020	i love the app but only 2 things are wrong it says that the portrait effect isn't compatible with my phone but everything else is 2nd when i get a messege it is not there i have to scroll so far down but besides that is awsome	1
02-May-2020	this is my favorite app so far! it is a really addicting app, and it helps if ur bored u can go right on it. u can go on tik tok for hours and u still wont get bored! u can talk fo ur friends, u can gain followers, u can follow other people too. i never get bored of being on this app. u can make dancing vids, singing vids, funny vids, and many more videos. it always makes me laugh. there is asmr, animals, dancing vids and alot more!! u can also do filters whenever u make a vid. it is really cool	4
28-Mar-2020	the experience with tiktok so far is great, everything is fine and running smoothly. keep updating it and that's all i have to say...	2
07-Apr-2020	tiktok is very unique app.its help you to show your talent.this app help you to become a famous person.but for a newcomer it is very difficult to show his video among the people. it gives you enjoyment and make your mind fresh.	5
31-Mar-2020	tiktok is good app......but i only has one problem with tiktok. while shooting videos in tiktok there is no slow motion videos on the shooting page. so i request the tiktok owners to get that slow motion option, so that we start make more videos.....	0
22-Mar-2020	this app is the best! its so obsessive and i love it and love making tiktoks :) but it is 15+ for your own safety! have a good day/night/evening/morning/afternoon depending on where u are! :d	11
18-Mar-2020	i like this app. i only recently started using it but i like how you can edit your videos. if you're a star or something it can really help you. it's not so complicated for me to use.	6
03-Apr-2020	well, i really like the app, but i wanted to like a video. when i tried to like it, it said i have to sign up for it. so i did. it lets me like it, but now it won't let me comment or search for users. >:(	6
08-Apr-2020	you should do something with the "drag to set recording limit " section... idk if it's same for everyone but i need to struggle every time to set that limit. also i don't have the clip adjustment future...	-2
15-Apr-2020	using tik tok for 1 week thus far, i have and am enjoying it, theres no errors one thing tho is that it drains your battery quickly, but i like it so far!	1
24-Apr-2020	such a dirty useless and time wasting app this app is fully designed for only high level people because even a useless videos of celebrities will be having millions of likes but common man's videos will be ignored with zero views.... such a cheat app and only rich people can make fans and money with this app.what a cheap algorithm of this app. never think that you can become famous on this as it is very dirty	-9
16-Apr-2020	amazing. addictive. really good app. a few problems on the app with political stuff on the for you page. other than that it's amazing	1
01-Apr-2020	i can't get off this app! i'm 12 and i've been on tik tik since i was 8 years old and seriously it has changed i likes the old musically but this tik tik is still amazing keep up and we need more updates!! (and a higher chance at the fyp!)	8
03-Apr-2020	this app is amazing i can communicate with my friends during quarantine that's good also!! i love making vids to one thing that would be great to change is i cant have 3 accounts or the app will stop working thx for taking your time to read this from mackenzie	12
08-Apr-2020	great content, but not as good on androids as it is for iphones. i would rate it higher if the green screen effect was available on my new* samsung device. also sometimes very laggy when posting videos.	3
06-Apr-2020	it's a great app, i love it, but there seems to be a problem, there have been videos showing on my for you page so many times when i already have seen them	6
26-Apr-2020	the app has a promotion, but it doesn't work. my partner used my code but it didn't work, we both sent a message to get support, but nobody answered. really disappointing!	0
26-Mar-2020	it's amazing, the app runs well, you can follow your friends. it's great. i love it so much and u could post videos about ur talents or about ur day to day life â¤ðÿ§¡ðÿ’›ðÿ’šðÿ’™ðÿ’–ðÿ’œ	3
16-Apr-2020	i love this app so much. i have had it since 2016! i've had it since musical.ly and it's my favorite app and thing to do when i'm bored! i definitely recommend this app!!!!	7
22-Apr-2020	i like the app a lot but stitch is horrible and when i go to swipe right i go on to for you page and i am just trying to see the other person's videoss!?!?	5
22-Apr-2020	tik tok is a fun app and i love it but ever since 2020 started all the trends died and now tiktok is all about dances and zodiac signs. not going to lie but tik defenitly needs to improve on maybe some of there filters or something idk maybe just add a few new trends.	6
02-Apr-2020	it was fine until i am not able to download my own videos from tiktok to gallery i hsve some private videos but i am not able to save them now this should be resolve otherwise i'm done i have deleted my videos from gallery thinking they are on tiktok nd i can save them anytime but now this is happening ridiculous	8
29-Mar-2020	fantastic app i love it very much its imaging app i can not believe any such app can come in my life . everyone can show their skills by this app .i want you to be with me forever. i love tiktok very much .	7
29-Mar-2020	it is a great app when working correctly and whenever certain people don't get offended. the only problem i see is tik tok doesn't really pay attention to the reports being legit.	1
14-Apr-2020	this app needs to be perfect like a youtube. it's still having bugs. switching account never works. money is not everything. spend some money by hiring some professional software engineers.	5
26-Mar-2020	tiktok is a blast, and i have a great time with it. just wish more filters were compatible with my phone (lg stylo 4) and that it didn't crash so often. it has been crashing several times a day on me	0
31-Mar-2020	its a really good app but i havent been able to open it for two weeks and im sure that my internet connection its fine .i dont know what happend to it .if anyone knows please tell me!!	6
26-Mar-2020	need to add one more feature and that is rewind option... if anybody miss important thing in video they could rewind it and note the missing thing... otherwise it's good for entertainment... i like it...ðÿ˜ƒ	3
16-Apr-2020	i like tik tok, you can do anything you want to video on the app (if its appropriate) you feel more open in front of a camera than in front of people. i do miss musiclly.ly though	1
17-Apr-2020	the actual app itself is great however the content lately (april 2020) has been lackluster. you still have some good content but the majority has much to be desired	6
08-May-2020	it is an amazing app but i m not able to grow my account. many tiktokers who don't put any effords in making the video still thier videos are getting viral which is not fare. my username is usernameremoved and i want tiktok team to see my content and help me to grow my account otherwise i will not have any other option than uninstalling this app and tell my friends to do so. pls help and encourage my hard work and love for tiktok videos.thankyou	13
18-Mar-2020	it's actually really great it takes your boredom away but one thing i would change about it is making it so you can have albums of videos you save so you can go back and find them easier	5
26-Apr-2020	it is a good app but my videos not gone viral. i already have many followers but video views are not increased. please make the solution of this problem as soon as possible.	3
02-Apr-2020	it is one of the best apps i have ever downloaded, you can do so much things with this app and share you potential with the whole intire world without being afraid or ashamed of how you dance or sing but tik tok is one of the best socializing apps ever.	3
18-Apr-2020	wish all filters and sounds would be included with android chrome and other devices. you should change this so all users of your app have availability to all the filters and all the sounds not just iphone users .	0
16-Apr-2020	i think although it isnt as child friendly anymore it's a very cool and entertaining app where people can share their things to others and to show how things can be done differently i love how people are so confident on it aswell even though anyone can see x	11
29-Mar-2020	good working how you monitor your breathing during sex can affect your levels of pleasure, endurance and orgasms, so donâ€™t just start huffing and puffing. take deep, purposeful breaths that allow you to fully take in the moment. the more relaxed your breathing is, the more youâ€™ll enjoy the sexual experience. although trying new moves and playing with positions can be great, sometimes all you need is a new location to spice things up. try turning on your partner when theyâ€™re not in the bed. for i	7
01-Apr-2020	i'm 31 and i find it very fun and funny. i love making videos with my kids. it actually easy to use. i did have to youtube how to duet but that's about it.	12

18-Apr-2020	this is a great app to just get out there, make goofy videos, and just have fun! i love how tiktok doesn't censor christian views like certain platforms do. it could be better about screening soft porn, but other than that, it's great!	10
17-Apr-2020	this app is very useful to show our talent,energy and many more to others it is also useful to when our tv is damaged or any thing we can use tik tok.i like this app very much	3
03-May-2020	it's not working properly, video not been publishing properly by aap developer. also getting solution of users, if video not get published by the tiktok developer then, working in this platform is useless and waste of time	-2
20-Mar-2020	very easy to find and add effects and edit clips. automatically syncs movements to beats in the soundtrack you choose. can edit manually too.	1
20-Mar-2020	this app was to be so good until one month later it always says "no network connection" but i have a good connection.	6
26-May-2020	watermark not coming on my videos please solve this problem as soon as possible	0
05-Apr-2020	when you record with head phones in. there is a delay in playback without headphones. if you record something without head phones there is a delay in playback with headphones.	-2
15-Apr-2020	i absolutely love tiktok there is nothing wrong with the app except for when i want to use green screen and it says it doesnt work for this device which makes me sad so if you can fix it please do.	1
18-Mar-2020	super fun and basically you watch other people do dances and you can learn that dance by just watching that video also you can like their video you can even share it to any more of your social media and overall i just think it's a pretty cool app!	9
25-Mar-2020	this app is super addictive. i have been obsest since this was still musical.ly in 2014. thia game is just really , good, though it does have adds that oop up every once in a while.	3
19-Apr-2020	it's a wonderful place to find videos to not only uplift you, teach you, and make you feel like your not alone. but, to also find videos to make you laugh until you can't breathe	7
17-Apr-2020	all good, very entertaining app, but please avoid tapping limit. it's a worse feeling when it says 'tapping too fast, please come back after sometime'. please avoid this issue.	1
20-Mar-2020	the option "my sounds" or "import sounds from phone" doesn't exist despite the fact that i've already updated the app several times!	0
10-Apr-2020	it is a wonderful app provided some people understand this is not an app where you are judgemental or effect hatred or use it for threatening intimidating or even do moral policing or to the extent of posting inappropriate posts like sexually explicit materials. rather each user shall make efforts to come up with creativity or make informative videos. it has helped bring out talents by providing a virtual global platform.	-3
20-Mar-2020	i love tik tok but the only thing is that when u like to much videos it will say "your tapping to fast, take a break and when u do for 5 hours it will still say that. but other than that i love it	8
26-Mar-2020	very good appðÿ¤—ðÿ¤—. i love it and it is very easy to make a video and we can search a song but i don't know why "my sound" is not coming in my tiktok. but it's ok ðÿ™‚ðÿ™‚ my tiktok account is @usernameremoved	7
24-Mar-2020	nice game this is fun and i want to get famous to go on live this is fun mack more update it will be so cool if they add more songs cool thing we can face time each other and i can't sleep because of this and when i want to watch youtube i click tik tok this is great and follow people and sent people stuff most scary thing is to delete it or report. report is bad if you report people for nothing that is mean so download tik tok but don't report people for nothing only if there mean not okâœðÿ›‘â›”.	12
10-Apr-2020	i love the app, but the green screen effect dosent work on my phone which is a samsung galaxy s10 but it works on my friends phone and she has a samsung galaxy s10e there the same phone it honestly makes no sense	2
09-Apr-2020	i love this app, i can comunicate with friends and i love dancing to the videos. you can do basically anyrhing and i love going on it during qaurantine. i have no problme with this app. i love it so much. this was a genius idea of app choice.	11
13-Apr-2020	it is a very cool app and it can totally keep you busy and you can learn cool things like dance,life hacks,food hacks, singing and a lot of other things	4
14-Apr-2020	love this app! it has really been a good thing to take up spare time during these bad times! has brought a lot of smiles and caused families to bond in a creative way!	4
13-Apr-2020	actually this application is good even this application make many talented people but my problem is i have 4806 fans but tik tok not give me live option so this is wrong... thanks... (@usernameremoved) my tik tok idea…	1
16-Apr-2020	its so fun but i think they should stop banding lgbtq+ people on the app for posting about there problems or what they look like because its not meant to be sexual its juat them trying to be informational or confident and by banding them for showing off how proud they are of there own bodies brings down there confidence my choice would change if they were all more included	9
14-Apr-2020	it's filled with funny stuff and you can make friends on there and it's a good app a step there is people would try 2 scam you 2 liking their video and following their video and commenting their video and sharing their video that's the only thing bad about the app	4
19-Apr-2020	love tiktok, it's giving me the most exposure for my brand that i've ever been able to receive and that's the main reason i'm going to be investing more and more time in the app every single day.	0
16-Apr-2020	hi! i have done so much research/watched videos on how to go "live" i have 1700+ followers and i have never gone "live" ever before. i have downloaded the newest version of the app but am still not able to go live.	0

15-Apr-2020	love the app!!! very fun! but it has been known to be biased about what you see and what videos of yours get seen	-2
22-Apr-2020	i'll i love tik tok because you can dance to music you can watch people games you can click the little circle that tells you what the music is so you can click it and just came tik tok you can search people up that you know that can be your cousin friends favorite youtuber that's what i love to talk i love to dance i did when i was little seven or eight and 9	11

18-May-2020	worst app ever. people making videos are totally mad and there is nothing new in it. same content are followed by everyone. this app is totally useless. people in this app are having no talent. i dont support this app.	-3
09-Apr-2020	after the update! most of the thing's is not working accurately. i'm trying to send a particular video to messenger or put it as my day. i simply can't do that. please look into this	1
15-Apr-2020	amazing application i am very happy to see tiktok back this is the only platform where i can showcase my skill and see myself how i look .and public can also see and suggest in commments and give like but the one bad thing about tiktok only celebrities get more like then a normal ppl it's a tiktok strategy to attract the ppl but normal ppl never get likes like a famous celebraties and money people conplain about this some people are not happy with the tiktok including me .	14
24-Apr-2020	update idea ! it would be cool if you could create different folders for the sounds you have saved. so its not that confusing if you have saved more than 30 sounds saved.	5
28-Apr-2020	it's really good for everyone especially to those who are first in expressing their creativity. it's one of the best flatform for your talent	6

28-Mar-2020	it's amazing but when i tried getting on my other account (that's linked to my google my main one is linked to my instagram) it isn't letting me in no matter what i try (this was after the update)	4
19-Apr-2020	this app is not giving me live. this is a very bad app. you never install this up. it does not even reply to a problem to solve. youtube shorts is coming in a few days. @usernameremoved is my tiktok i'd check in tiktok	-5
15-Apr-2020	this is the best app ever there's so many new trends and you can make up to 1 minute videos (not that this matters but the girls are so pretty and some of the boys are the best looking boys ever for example josh richards, jeremy hutchins,cash baker, maverick baker, jaden hossler bryce hall,kio cyr, anthony reeves griffin johnson, tayler holder,payton moormier, tony lopez, nick austin chase hudson, noen eubanks luca schaefer) best app ever	11
02-Apr-2020	it's very fun and addictive but i think it would be a better app if you have a starter video on how to make the videos and that so if you can do that it would be very useful for starter creater's	8
02-Apr-2020	great app but the app keeps freezing anytime i try to access music saved on my phone. it is really annoying and i still can't get past it	0
29-Mar-2020	honestly, aside from the page refreshing when you turn off and on the screen at times, i'd say there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this, i get a good laugh everyday	2
30-Mar-2020	it is about 1 month that it doesn't work for me anymore!!! everytime i open the app, it says there's no connection!!!! please tell me why?!	3
26-Mar-2020	i love this app you can have a private account and you can still make new friends! im always on it. the only downside is that you have to have internet in order to make videos or watch videos	1
03-Apr-2020	it's a good app, i've made so many friends on here and it's boosted my self esteem. i do wish the algorithm would get fix. i'd also like it if i could put click able links in my bio though	7
19-Mar-2020	i love the options and the way of creating videos,and it's really a best way to pass our time nd make our mood good....thanks a lot tiktokâ¤ but i want tiktok to make availables slowmo options for all phones,android nd i phones both,please!	7
15-Apr-2020	rotated the favorite button from the bottom to the middle? so now when i click favorite instead it says not interested messing up what i favorite. also everytime someone comments a video on a comment you liked you get notified? so 20 notifications outta nowhere.	14
20-Apr-2020	well they made a new update where you can reply a comment with a video but please can you make it work with a samsung galaxy note because my friends can do it but i'd like to do it to so please let us samsung galaxy note phones do that also there's too much ads now and whenever someone sends me something it never shows it so can you guys please fix this if you do i will be so happy and i want to do the reply comments with a video	9
18-Apr-2020	excellent app to reach to people in totally different way. amazed how people trust this aap and let their private life and talent to see by anyone. have good features too, we can limit the audience.	9
19-Apr-2020	this app is cool but the thing is i get 45 or 6 views always in my all videos and likes are not coming now in my videos even im working hard and always glitch like always glitch i cant comment smoothly in any of other videos	4
02-Apr-2020	this app is amazing you can make your account private or public you can have as many videos as you want and you can go live when you get 1000 followers and there is no ads! there is a for you page that you can get on!	4
21-Apr-2020	too bad app, difficult to use, sinup problem. video loading problem. frequently use problem. i downloaded the app very excitedly but got hurted, totly waste of time.	-5
04-May-2020	i wish i could have 2 backgrounds at the same time on like the flame shades and the fire or maybe i can and i just don't know how to do it. fun app though.	5
07-Apr-2020	the community is solid and that's pretty hard to find nowadays. sadly the ads are starting to get stupid. probably gonna uninstalled if it gets any worse.	0
18-Apr-2020	i love this app, the best app, ever in the whole entire app store, i'm not kidding, but not don't even put that in quotations, but, oh my god, like i met so much people in life, and it's just like boom.	10
08-Apr-2020	i do like making and watching video's. the 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's hard to match/mix/edit video and audio. i import mine from premiere pro. also audio is sometimes limited to work with.	0
31-Mar-2020	its not getting downloadedðÿ˜”. earlier i deleted it for some reason but when i downloaded it again its saying to update tiktok and whn i am updating its showing "send feedback or update it ðÿ˜¤again"whatðÿ˜’? pleaseðÿ˜© fix it!!!! its not getting installed.	3

01-Apr-2020	ive had tiktok since 2018 and its been amazing. it creates so much fun and so many memories and helps express creativity. although i eish it had a setting that only one person of your choicr can see a specific video..	6
28-Apr-2020	love it. if you don't have a lot of free time don't download. nearly all the videos they picked for me make me smile and laugh.	3
04-Apr-2020	it's my favourite app with insta. the only problem is its sometimes inappropriate and explicit could that be filtered out plz or there could be a setting in manage your account that can filter out any explicit and inappropriate stuff. best regards usernameremoved	-1
03-Apr-2020	great app! gives me ideas i've never thought of ! just one thing that makes me irritated is that i post funny videos but barely get views and don't even have one follow lol it's so hard to attract attention. follow me on tiktok bigdream02	4

04-Apr-2020	overall great app. just frustrating when the front page refreshes automatically when i accidentally swipe away from it, so sometimes i lose track of something that seemed interesting.	-1
08-Apr-2020	not bad app, but it only keeps saying no network connection like an hour or two after i uninstalled it and reinstalled it because of that same problem.	-3
21-Mar-2020	it is a pretty good platform with a lot of creativity and fun. tho its not perfect, i overall enjoy tik tok. keep up the good work.	9
28-Apr-2020	hi... i love this app and i am very active on it too. but the problem is that i dont get many views or likes on my videos. even i dont get many followers too. i am very tired of seeing this all the time. i am posting my videos with lots of effort only in hope that i will get likes, followers and lots of views but it doesn't happen... this is the reason that i am giving only two stars to this app ..	6
02-Apr-2020	started this app as a joke and i'm addicted. this app has taken over my life (in a good way). you learn so much on it like weight loss tips, mental information, food ideas and you get to express your self in many different ways and watch others express themselves. i love tik tok soooo much!! ðÿž‰	7
26-Mar-2020	it's a great way to express how you feel, and your able to show your amazing talents. it gives other opportunities like become a famous person or being noticed by the person's idol. you can make content and be you, that's what's great about it.	16
13-Apr-2020	it's a great app, but lately i've been getting ads every other post. i still love it though. would reccomend to anybody who loves comedy and music.	10
14-Apr-2020	fun, i wonder if it has filters for a younger audience but, a fun little app for sure. it's really addicting don't download if you want to be a productive member society.	9
21-Apr-2020	i like this app very much but since last few weeks i have faced many problems regarding vidieo views the views is normally up to 50 to 100 so i cannot reach to many people so plz fix this issue my username-harsh_narayan2681	1

14-Apr-2020	i absolutely love tik tok, i've only had one problem that i can't seem to solve but apart from that, don't second guess it, just get it because it's fantastic! ðÿ˜†ðÿ˜†ðÿ˜†	2
14-Apr-2020	i like the app, im on it apl the time. but, i do not like the fact that your private videos are scattered everywhere. i would prefer that the private would have a folder kinda like drafts.	6
16-Mar-2020	it's an amazing app even though it is addictive, but they are so many adds that pop at the beginning when you enter the app and it gets annoying	4
24-Apr-2020	i absolutely love this! i can sit up at night and laugh an laugh all night! only 1 time i saw something that i felt shouldn't be on here. for the most part it's clean, and hours of laughter ahead!	6
01-May-2020	this app only boosts the videos of famous tik tokers and doesn't let new users to go, the algorithm of this app is the worst ever....even after complaining about the problems to their team they don't respond...	-4
08-May-2020	hello 'tiktok team i love very much this app is amazing is that my account (@usernameremoved) is fully freezed i post 7-8 videos daily i also converted my account to pro account i do a lot of hard work but after some days my account went down i think my videos doesn't go to forupage please help me to solve my problem tiktok team to get more views and like on my account (@usernameremoved)	10

02-Apr-2020	it's a way better version musicly and depending on what i like, it organizes certain tiktoks that i may like which it makes me addicting but at least they have a system that will stop you from liking videos if you have been on for to long	8
24-Mar-2020	its a pretty good app , i just miss musically (i think i spelled it right) i feel that it could be a bit better on a few things.	4
06-May-2020	the app is fantastic....but now i am facing a problem...i can't like any videos ..when i try i am getting a notification that your tap is too fast take a break...why so? is liking limited??? please reply as soon as possible	17

30-Mar-2020	this app is great! you can make videos and post them and get likes and followers or you can make a private account so only people you choose can see your videos! its a really fun app and so addicting, i highly recommend it!! definetely the best app ever!!	11
26-Mar-2020	it's the best app i have, i like it cause with the ads you don't have to wait for the x, but with tik tok you can just keep scrolling.	5
13-Apr-2020	i have crossed 4800 fans..but i did not get live option (@usernameremoved) your app is very good but your rules are very bad you don't do this another way people use other app so please give me live feature but your rules very bad officialy i say that your app and your rules very bad if i don't get live feature than i suggest other people not to use this app thank u	-3
22-Apr-2020	tiktok is easy to use but my id is getting freeze day by day. i think only tiktok is only for popular creators or for those who is posting nonsense. so overall my experience with this app is bad.	4
31-Mar-2020	i really like the app, i think it would be a little better if they didn't have a cap on how many likes you could do within a certain timeframe, but i also know it's saved my productivity a couple times lol	9
14-Apr-2020	really my experience on tiktok is awesome..i also have an account as @usernameremoved and tiktok really gives us all features we want to make videos..all the effects are awesome and the games tiktok uploaded is really outstanding....guys download it without any hesitation its outstanding appðÿ˜ž	19

27-Mar-2020	it is amazing because you can have your account and you don't even need to the post anything you can just get followers just like that and you don't need a really follow your followers and then youtubers that you didn't even know that had a tiktok and you get to get like sneak peeks of videos that you like to get to get sneak peeks of like music actually fun and you get to add favourite of your songs on your videos so like my favourites one of them is say so and there's dances. amazing!!!!!!!!	26

24-Mar-2020	i enjoy tiktok alot but i dont understand how this app works, i download funny content almost every day and im seen by very litte people dont matter how many #tags i use. then ive seen other profiles that have 5 videos (resently posted too) and they are blown of views and like so... what are they doing to be famous so fast? or what im doing wrong??? ______ im changing my review cause overall i love the app but when i try to approach c.r they never answer email... like never	28
27-Apr-2020	it's very frustrating that none of my videos have any views. the first two had views and then suddenly the rest have none. 0 views, it's hard to believe.	-3
25-Apr-2020	i give it full starts because it's a nice app only problem is it won't let me login to my previous accounts which is annoying i tried logging in my previous account and it keeps telling me wrong password or username and i know it's correct i tried my second account it let's me do the verification thing then it tells me again wrong password or username but it's correct can u fix this it is irratating.	-5
01-May-2020	this app is super cool it doesn't have any problems it let you make videos whenever you want to and it doesn't lag i would really recommend this app because it is fun it just takes a lot of date and space	8
20-Apr-2020	it is a good app to watch funny videos. but has many glitches sometimes and doesn't load when i have perfect internet connection.	10
19-Mar-2020	so i downloaded it as a joke. but i actually like it. editing is fast and easy. and lets be real their are enough # for everygroup.	2
19-Mar-2020	this app is fun and you can like a lot of different kinds of videos and you can make your own videos with different audios or you can make your own audio to. i love tik tok!!â¤â¤ðÿ˜œðÿ˜œâ˜ºâ˜ºðÿ˜ðÿ˜	9
25-Mar-2020	i love this app so much and if someone's ran out of minutes i can text them easily on their account and this is one of the best games ever i gave this a five star rating cuz i just love it so much and i love the person or people that made this love you	15
25-Mar-2020	at first i was like "oh ill never download tik tok, thats cringe af". i got bored one day and decided to just give it a change, and i love it, there's so much funny content and even some sexy content. the cringe that you would expect isnt even there, if you want cringe, you have to search for it. so download this app and you will not regret it.	5
30-Mar-2020	its fun. i do not really like the like limit because thats when i find the best videos lol. i love this app its a great way to make new friends and have a laugh. i hope i get verified one day.	15
30-Mar-2020	it is the best app i could have it allowed you to express your self and also find friends i post nearly every day on it i love it there is nearly every song in it you can choose from star wars theme tune to lady gaga i also like if a video is inappropriate then it tackes it off	6
19-Apr-2020	the "not interested" button literally does not work and im being forced to watch the same stuff i dont want to see over and over again. please bring back the old algorithm where a user can actually control what they want to see on the fyp	2
25-Mar-2020	love it although it lags when i try to record videos currently the app is broken. i am following multiple accounts but only one account is showing up in my following list. please fix this	-1
23-Apr-2020	if you're like me and you absolutely despise push notifications, then tik tok is not for you. i turned all push notifications off when i first downloaded, and a few weeks went by wothout any. now, all of a sudden, im getting at least 5 a day. all of them are still checked off.	2
03-Apr-2020	it doesn't notify me on the app when people like my videos or nothin like that. keep trying to refresh the app but doesn't make a difference. also don't like how all viewers don't even see your posts.	6
29-Mar-2020	tik tok is overall just a wonderful app. it lets me communicate with my friends, it lets me post videos, it lets me watch videos, and i can control who watches my videos. 10/10	4
01-Apr-2020	videos whether funny, inspirational, etc...are amazing and to know an older crowd (40's & up) are now doing it is great. since i ceased doing facebook long time ago i only do tt an ig, now that i do tt i hardly do ig. keep up the good work ðÿ˜‰	7
06-Apr-2020	it's awesome!!! helps when you are filling low. when you want inspiration. when you wanna have a good laugh. and even motivation. this is a great app.	9
05-Apr-2020	i am posting tiktok videos with my original sound. but i am not able to recreate them or tap on the sound option. i am a poet and have been posting my original sounds since long. why is this issue coming now?	3
05-Apr-2020	love it!! if you can only make it so that you can continue viewing upcoming videos without having to slide upward?	3
10-Apr-2020	lobe this app so much, you can do alot of fun things but the only problem is that i can't go live for some some reason i don't know why. but after all it is amazing!	2
10-Apr-2020	love the app but i still haven't been able to get a clickable link/website link in my profile. i've been patiently waiting, i signed up for the tester account and pro account. do i need to do anything else? thank you for the awesome app!	9
25-Apr-2020	hi team, my username is sonakshi.vermaa. i would like to bring this in notice that this app is good but it's not promoting small creators who actually create good content or not copy others. its promoting only a few who are already on top. previously i was getting more than 200-500 views but these days i'm getting only 50-80 views which is less than 100. so could you please make some good changes on this app so that it can actually be fun for others too not only for famous creators. thank you.	22
25-Apr-2020	quality needs to be fixed for recordings, i have a s10 plus and it's kinda sad how i'm not able to use the camera to its full potential.	-2
14-Apr-2020	good fun and highly addictive. daily challenges and trends to keep you entertained and even take part yourself. â˜º	4
29-Apr-2020	this app is good as i enjoy myself by seeing some videos but the problem is that it waste a lot of data if i see only15 videos so i request to lower the usage of data.thank you sayonara,konichiva...	2
13-May-2020	i love this app using this more than 10months but now the view on my videos is just 50 to 60 i face this problem a lot i am very active but still this problem with can't wait solve hope u resolve this issue soon love to tiktok team tiktok ðÿ†” @_usernameremoved	8
05-May-2020	worst experience i'm facing with this app hanging while playing the drafts video for second time..and fully lag in visual..my phone has 8gb ram..and everything is perfect except this app..	2
20-Apr-2020	it was good at first then the ads started showing up....and there is alot of bullying...amd there are fake accounts and people accounts are being hacked.....people claiming to being somone else...people making up things to get famous..and people doing smoking and drinking and their are young children on the app.....it is good for wasting time but there us bulling and bad thinhs happening on this app...it was nice at first but bad things are happening.....people are also being racist ............	-5
20-Apr-2020	i love this app and all but there are two reasons why i rated 4 stars. the reasons are tiktok takes a lot of space to download (for lg aristo) and its very hard to get views.	2
19-Apr-2020	important update : make a optione where we can find our liked videos from a particular profile. when we inter a profile we should be able to find our liked videos from in a different option in between the profile owner video and his liked videos. please do update it, becouse when i inter a profile whom i liked a video it took so much time to find the video that i liked earlier.ðÿ™‚	11
21-Apr-2020	very nice app...but the app should ve a nice slowmo quality...the picturization doesnt come well after adding the slowmo from tik tok...so we ve to use another apps for slowmo...kindly work on it	6
16-Mar-2020	i've been using to talk for a while and recently me and my friend follow each other and then all of a sudden i guess messages weren't coming through to her account that i wanted to follow her back even though she didn't block me and i've tried multiple times to request and send her messages and nothing's coming to her, please get back to me asap. thank you	3
22-Mar-2020	pretty great, however, on some longer videos, the video just stops 3/4 of the way through and i cant figure out why it does that.	-1
22-Mar-2020	amazing app!! you can watch all kinds of things like dance, comedy, jokes, tricks and gameplay. this is also very addictive.	2
23-Mar-2020	great app, but the billing needs to stop but tiktok doesn't do too much bout it but besides that it's a great app, there are such amazing people on his app too.	9
14-Apr-2020	very very toxic app do not download it unless you want to get your heart broken from getting banned for literally doing nothing tiktok is a horrible app to download never trust this app for your life you may see the other reviews and see that it's a good app for other people but it's an absolutely toxic and horrible app believe me for my personal experiences	-10
01-Apr-2020	it's bad enough when the platform you're on interjects itself into a community issue through bans and removal of voice. it's even worse when that platform sides with manipuative and vile people just because they are popular. unban the people that have spoken out against grooming, sexual assault, and fetishization. this is low.	-9
01-Apr-2020	so fun and amazing and also a good learning experience would defo recommend it has a good protective environment and takes down any inappropriate videos and allows you to have other a private or all seeing account	14
29-Mar-2020	one of the worst apps ever, it's annoying, its way too obsessive(not for me) and the trends are just terrible, there are no good videos, just people begging for likes and followers left right and center, so please fix this app or god help me i will go insane	3
05-Apr-2020	great app, you can communicate with others and share your thoughts by commenting, sharing on different apps and duetting or reacting, it's amazing, once you get it you get addicted	1
08-Apr-2020	this is the best app. we are enjoying it very much. there are so many videos and also we can chat. we can make videos... and it make is feel relaxing ...	5
15-Apr-2020	i used this app past two year it is very entertaining .i love to make video on this app..easy to make video .it develop my confidence .through this app we can show our talent to the public..without any hesitation and shyness	9

03-Apr-2020	this app isn't as i expected .i can't even see any videos and it says "culdn't open video .now has been two days that says the same thing .can you please fix it ?	4
03-May-2020	tiktok monitoring system is one of the worst!!! they even removed a decent videos which is in no way violating their community guidelines.... this happened many times already. when i appealed, they restored back sometimes, but sometimes they don't. this show's their enability to track the videos which are violating and which are not. ðÿ‘žðÿ‘ž	-5
30-Mar-2020	its a really cool app! it gives you the best experience. there are so many videos i can make you laugh, smile and even cry. so many moving things! i love this app	9
13-Apr-2020	ok...i wish i could give you 1000 stars. amazing site. if you haven't tried it, you should. very entertaining. no glitches, not a lot of advertisements.	3
31-Mar-2020	the screen screen filter won't put what i want to put up...and there's a reason than i need that filter with my content but other than that it's really good....please fix the issue tiktok	1
31-Mar-2020	i love this app but i hate when i follow to much people and like people's post alot i get this thing that says "you are liking to much" "take a break" and "you are following to much" why do we need this!?	7
19-Apr-2020	not going to lie i love this app, but with the new update its getting worse. with the new stitch feature others can get credit for videos that you worked hard on.	2
30-Mar-2020	my favorite app! although i can't use some filters, like greenscreen and such. that kinda bothers me. but the settings are amazing and the design is awesome	6
29-Mar-2020	i do enjoy the app quite a bit. but the app definitely flags a lot of videos that shouldn't be flagged. and they dont flag the videos that should be taken down.	2
31-Mar-2020	it is a great app, you get to describe your feelings and feel like in social media but a little more teen friendly.	5
15-Apr-2020	i used different phone the app works but the thing is it doesnt synchronized the viewers and likers prompt one to another of the vid to both phone if you used it, still i loved it ðÿ˜ thanks!	5
07-Apr-2020	tik tok is an amazing app.you can get likes and follows just by dancing or something else! lots of comedy! you can post any videos any time! might be some hate but don't let people bring you down! ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ i'm laughing because of comedies right now.	4
12-Apr-2020	i love this app very much, it's so fun. you can do dances and so many more things like challenges or watch people make food.	5
21-Apr-2020	i love this game when your bored you can go on and watch videos for hours one time i've been on there for 3 hours straight this is why i gave it five cuz it's the best game in the world so you should download	5
24-Mar-2020	it is the dummiest app ever. hard for registration, ask for to much personal data, ful your mail with spam, and a tousand of stuped videos, that are not related to your interest. just waist my time on it	-1
12-Apr-2020	im using this app on samsung s9 . this version dosen't support effects properly, video filters doesn't work good like older version , after applying filters video becomes blurry and over exposed.	5
09-Apr-2020	my videos have not reached to public means less than hundred members have seen them but others videos are going viral and many hindi songs are not at all there even which are trending songs and many are only for 30 seconds! in short people like me cannot make videos as they are not going to reach at least 100 views.	4
20-Mar-2020	i love it how you can talk with your friends but i do wish that you can go live on a private account.i am hoping they add that , but you should download tiktok because it is amazing.	6
22-Mar-2020	so i love tiktok. great way to keep busy. but after using it for weeks, i can no longer send tiktoks through facebook messenger or any messaging apps. please advise!	6
20-Apr-2020	fantastic fun just wish i knew how to find lip synch option to try it at least, not sure where you get the audio from? nothing in help or support when you search on lip synch. please help	15
26-Apr-2020	this app is gud bttt now a days my videos arent going viral .... live option used to come earlier bt now live option is also not there. this problem is not only faced by me bt many more users either they r famous or new users. try to fix it. here is my account@usernameremoved . gmail account- @usernameremoved .	0
17-Mar-2020	really fun! you can make videos, alot of children then teens though and you can find and follow your friends on tik tok (only if they have tik tok) so i recomend getting this app.	0
15-Apr-2020	very disappointed from this app.. i want to upload a vedio from my gallery and it's not working..it's hanging all the time..plz give me a review to solve this problem..	0
30-Mar-2020	one of the best apps in this world to show your talent. it's give you update people and you can also watch new things i really love it and i suggest my friends to installed this apps. m loving it.	8
20-Apr-2020	love, love, love this app. it's not only for young kids, adults can have just as much fun or even more! some young uneducated people can be rude in the comments, but otherwise, this app let's you be wherever you want to be.	12
23-Apr-2020	it's ok. beyond irritating it's designed to be so difficult to exit the app. so annoying i don't care to open it any longer and might uninstall. definitely will the second a new app comes out that does the same thing but no drama exiting.	-5
21-Apr-2020	i love this app, i really like to watch and make these 60 second videos that can get up to millions of likes, you can also choose to have a private or public account, you can follow popular creators including, charli d'amelio and even popular musicains or song writers like lizzo.	15
07-Apr-2020	it is a perfect app because u can dance lip sing and talk with other people and u can like videos if u like them and u can comment and follow it is just a amazing app if your seeing this u should definitely use the app it is incredibly good	11
11-Apr-2020	it's a amazing way to connect with people and show your true self. but it takes for ever to load sometimes but it's still a amazing app	10
15-Apr-2020	ok, for one there's a lot of swearing, and i mean a lot of swearing. thats basically the downside to tiktok. other than that people make really good videos and funny ones too. the thing is try to make videos that are trending. goodluck!! =)	8
16-Apr-2020	it is so unsafe to make phone numbers permanent without there being another option besides using the old number to change it to the new one.	-2
17-Apr-2020	it's fun, and you could do a lot with the videos. the only issue is the videos are pretty buggy sometimes. otherwise i would highly recommend it!!	3
25-Apr-2020	love the app so much great performance but which there was a auto scroller button a side of a video because eating and watching is hard amagine watching and eating with out having to scroll ps.even if its not added il still use this all	2
24-Mar-2020	this app is fun and all, but they have a list of community guidelines a mile long. they will remove your video and not even tell you what you violated. there needs to be a way to verify you are over 18 so that only other adults can view your page or certain videos.	5
19-May-2020	lol i don't like tis app seriously it's just wasting my time n money,now you'll think how it waste my money so i'll explain it,as u can know that the app which i hate is controlled on a mobile/android device and that device works on battery, the battery will get charged by electricity orr electricity ka to bill ata or every indian citizen know abt it ki bijlee ka bill tera bap bharega..here i completed my tow words ty jaihind jaibharat ðÿ™‹	-7
12-Apr-2020	this is the only app in my phone that will not connect to the internet. tried deleting and re-installing several times but still says not connected to the internet.	0
31-Mar-2020	omgoodness where to start so i took a star away because of the on going drama, and the lack of action. but i love this app a lot. it is very addictive and time consuming. but i've met some awesome people from all over the world. this is not a children's app. remeber this app is 13+ there is a filter button to help try and filter out more adult/mature content. but it doesnt work 100% of the time. if you let your kids use this app make sure you are monitoring what they are looking at.	7
01-Apr-2020	this is a good and very entertainment app. but there's a problem., i complained one problem but there is no any action. so i'm upset because of this.	-6
01-Apr-2020	it's a fine app but when i want to post my videos they never post and this gets me angry and i have reported it several times but i haven't got any changes and i also cant like videos so can you please fix that so i can post vidoes and on my following it doesn't show the videos of the people i follow it only show suggestions to follow creaters but i dont want to follow verified people and i just want to see the videos of the people i follow and it glitches so can you please fix that im beging u	6
19-Mar-2020	it is a super fun app when you are bored or, just another great way to reach out with old friends, or make a chat with them. you should 100% download this app it is free!	9
21-Mar-2020	its amazing. you get to lip simc and dance which is good but even better you gain followers. i have over 190k on my mormal phone and its just idk no words describe how amazing this app is. no bugs or anything download it..	13
21-Mar-2020	when i use the app at night, it constantly pauses for 2-5 seconds at a time. for every tik tok i watch, it pauses 2-3 times. please fix this:)	3
15-Apr-2020	very worst experience, i am using from 2018 but still i didn't get any view more than 100, i don't know what wrong with tiktok.	-5
20-Apr-2020	i dont like the fact that some songs we can do because of where we live. please fix that tiktok. other than that amazing app will keep you entertained for hours	3
05-Apr-2020	i love everything about this app ,i've made some amazing friends. the videos you are able to create is amazing and you get to make great memories a long the way	14
01-Apr-2020	when i post any video it takes one round move then collects views & likes after meanwhile i think the post doesn't get its another round move so that subsequent views & likes can be achieved. it likes that it get set aside. kindly give a post the random chance of views	8
18-Apr-2020	very disappointed with this app..the views on my videos became even more less than before. i have reported this problem with my id sukkujyoti21 but the problem didn't solved	-6
17-Apr-2020	i love this app like i'm always on it bc it is fun but however most songs i can't use bc of copyright reasons which is ok i guess but every summer it deletes my account and it kinda makes me mad bc it takes me a whole year and half to get back all my followers but it's really fun to be on	10
22-Apr-2020	hi tiktok team. this problem of freezing is occurring since post few months and i'm not getting proper view in my video will require your help to permanent fix this i am following all the guidelines of tiktok and expeet help from your awaiting positive response from your end hope you will clarify my issues incase your require any further points on this topic do let me know i would move happy to share please fix it tiktok i'd @usernameremoved	11
02-Apr-2020	fun and entertaining. dont let the younger ones tell you you're too old. this has been fun and mood lifting. people are having fun here. some great humor. its addictive.	15
17-Apr-2020	the content is fine but the app is very slow and im trying to log in to my acount on my new phone but it sau my e-mail adress ismt valid (wich i know it is) so i could use some help.	2
30-Apr-2020	the app itself is fine. but what is not is the messaging system. some people need someone to talk to and you guys took that away. think about all of the kids under 16 that have made good friends but can no longer talk to the people they have made friends with.	1
09-Apr-2020	for my perception it's best application,,i like it,, whenever i use this app i feel like this is tv,,this appl u can see all like dance ,mimicry,comedy,romance, advertising,n all..thank you tiktok...i think it's better than tv..	11
07-May-2020	amazing app .but there is one problem that in notifications fans are following me but in id my fan following is decreasing . plz correct the problem . @usernameremoved	2
19-Apr-2020	so i really like this app you can make videos but the reason that i rated 4 stars is that i found out that tik tok can save your videos even when you didn't post them now they know your information but it is a really good app and i got alot of people to know me but still they know your information so still i really don't trust this app when i redo a video they save the video that i didn't like and i kept a video in my drafts then it popped up in my page btw my tik tok name is halool.77	12
18-Apr-2020	the audio is horrible it actually blew out my speaker on my s9+ if anyone else's phone is going through the same problem tic toc is responsible for fixing this problem. this phone wasn't cheap..	-5
25-Apr-2020	fun app but cant hide descriptions. people post videos with txt on the screen and cant read it due to the description. would give it 5 stars if there was a way to hide the descriptions.	-2
23-Apr-2020	this app does not have the feature of live. this app costs a lot of mobile data. it would have been great to have given the feature of live. bad application	0
05-Apr-2020	i like it but why do i have much less editing options on the app than everyone else??? i sent a message to report a problem but never got a response. please help	10
09-Apr-2020	i rate this a three because many people say that your information gets sent to another country and it knows your location but i loved it before this so i guess i have uninstall it	3
26-Apr-2020	they need to make it where we can use our number for other account bc what happens when we delete the app and we had a to make a new one and can't use your number to chat bc it has already been used	0
03-Apr-2020	tik tok for me is pretty good so far. i have no problems with it but the camera work. it doesn't work as well with androids and that's frustrating for me. but aside from that, it's a good app.	2
29-Apr-2020	it is a brilliant app i recommend this to everyone it's family friendly and it is really fun but when you log in it shows an add on the other hand, you can post your own videos with really cool affects and many more it a new chance to make friends to so you should download the fantastic app	19
20-Apr-2020	this is not a review this is more of a suggestion could you make some hidden eastereggs in the app not a real egg like the type you find in games like for instince you click the button home 5 times you get an easteregg i dont have many ideaa about it but heres one u could do make the text rainbow	4
26-Mar-2020	i love this app soo much it allows you to show creativity and it's very private! i think the age requirement is true for tiktok though! i wish i could give this app more than 5 stars!	6
26-Mar-2020	amazing and so fun as for you can do whatever comes to your mind and you can be creative with whatever and if you want your videos to be private tik tok will allow you to do that and you can go on live!!!ðÿ‘‰ðÿ‘ˆðÿ˜ðÿ˜ðÿ˜ðÿ­ðÿ­ðÿ­	8
25-Mar-2020	it is a fun app also you need to be careful sometimes about what you post or the people you follow, but me and all of my friends love the app to have fun make videos to smile and remember memories we post on tiktok. ðÿ¥°	15
26-Mar-2020	i love this app although some of my shakes get stopped. also, it sometimes glitches out and the battery drains so pls can u fix it? (it's not that bad tho! :)	5
31-Mar-2020	it's pretty flippin great lol its quarantine time and so this comes in extra handy because it's so much fun. making ur own videos is easy and enjoyable and watching other tiktoks makes the time flow by so quick. i reccomend it lol	13
31-Mar-2020	although it is good app to to show your talent and engaged with audience but there is a problem,, after uploading so many videos with good content no response from audience (dont know why) is disappointing ðÿ˜­	4
01-Apr-2020	it's an amazing app but i wish it also works offline for those who don't have wifi or their wifi doesn't work well.	4
05-Apr-2020	the app is amazing. i have been bored a lot recently and tiktok has helped with this a lot. you can also find talents you never knew you had, for example: dancing, comendy e.t.c.	-2
26-Apr-2020	i love this app and i am very active on it too.but the problem is that i don't get many views on my vedios . i get 40 to 50 on an average on my vedios. even after posting the problem with tiktok team in the app my problam is not solf. i see vedio with not beauty and creativety million views. it's socking and tarbaling too. please resolve the problem. i love tiktok and want more views my vedios.please please help.. tiktok please help.....@usernameremoved	11
11-Apr-2020	i love it this is so much fun you should try if you don't you're being left out this app is amazing like i got so many like you could do so many stuff so if you're not doing it you do not know funny you just being left out!!!	19
24-Apr-2020	the app is fine, but multiple filters are not available for example, the green screen, which is basically used 9/10, which makes it unenjoyable. tik tok, when will you add filters for android's and not just for apple?	3
13-Apr-2020	great app. however, i would like to be able share videos from this app directly on facebook, instead of having to send them to friends only.	3
17-Apr-2020	i love this app and how interactive it is, i can meet lots of new people and watch some really funny videos. everyone on here is so nice and supportive!!	10
22-Apr-2020	i've felt so many different emotions since i downloaded tiktok. some are gut busting laughs while some are tear jerking and yet some just make you scratch your head, but i love it.	4
11-May-2020	love this app and am regular on this as a creator ,but due to no views more than 30 it's become demotivating . don't know about the fault as i have followed all community guidelines, quality,clarity,unique content , whatsoever needed. id is - @usernameremoved	-2
02-Apr-2020	its a very good app we can express our talents in this app its really good but ya some of the filters i can't get it . it shows that it doesn't support my phone so please solve it.........	10
20-Apr-2020	i am very dissatisfied with tiktok because i have been close to tax for one year while using tiktok, i did not have the option of live nor does the views increase. i request tiktok to help me, neither will i uninstall the tiktok app. my tiktok id isã€pandit_boy00ã€‘. thanku	0
17-Apr-2020	if i shoot with proper music, later while uploading the sound varies with video...y so? this is happening from so many month. horrible experience	-1
06-Apr-2020	its a great app but theres lots of anyoying videos and people though other than that its really good and a great way to meet people, get kinda famous, learn dances, and find more songs!	9
31-Mar-2020	my phone broke but i am going to start again! thx tik tok!! and i really love it, the controls are easy and like i said if your phone breaks or whatever device, you can login!	5
05-Apr-2020	poor... talented videos do not get views. but worst and poor videos are getting too many views and likes.. one of the fraudulent app i have seen. this app is really very much not deserved for the one star. there is no way to unselect that one star.. really zero stars should be to this app. such an worst..	-17
25-Mar-2020	its a fun simple app if your bored you can make videos yourself with different types of music it is very intertaning i personaly think it is intertaning try it for yourself !ðÿ™ƒ	2
04-Apr-2020	i love this app so much i could use it whenever i want to make videos and i could text my friends this is the best app i could ever use this is such a really good app and i just honestly rated 5-stars this is just straight-up the best!!ðÿ’•ðÿ’•ðÿ’–ðÿ’–ðÿ˜ðÿ˜	13
09-Apr-2020	i love this app because you can do so much creative videos or if you dont want to post you can still watch very entertaining videos that are like only 15 seconds.	10
17-Mar-2020	profiles dont load and show up empty it's hard to avoid content you dont like unless you block each individual account. (thats you garyvee) most of the content is not funny, entertaining or just false.	-4
20-Apr-2020	it's too good to express feeling and go with the trend. i enjoy a the songs a lot. i really like to use it.	8
20-Apr-2020	i have been using tiktok for a long time, but till today i have done much, do not know why? i have ever seen wrost tiktoker, it becomes more viral. i am very disappointed of this matter. still i am giving 2 stars in rating to tiktok. because some things are also good my tik id @usernameremoved	4
17-Apr-2020	it's a great app but 1 small problem live is not properly available. so this problem is very heart less. so please solved this problem as soon as possible. thanks	-1
01-Apr-2020	i love this app but i do think younger kids should not use it i have one problem i am trying to make a second account it will not let me.i reported this problem 2 times and it is still not fixed	-1
01-Apr-2020	consistantly the content is both humorous and thought provoking, my hats off to the publishers for providing a fun way to waste much more time than i ever should have. :-d	5
21-Mar-2020	i really enjoy the app because you get to be creative with you're video's. i've had it since it was musically and i really miss it):	0
04-May-2020	before i used to like this app.. but nowadays i cannot upload the sounds or music from my play list (mobile).. only it is showing track and favorites.. consider this and do some favour it	4
14-Apr-2020	i like watching videos on there, but you can't even use green screen on androids. all devices should be able to use all effects ðÿ˜¶ðÿ˜¶ðÿ˜’ðÿ˜’	2
06-Apr-2020	this app is really fun but you have to make sure not to bump into innapropriate tiktoks. this app is a great way to let out your spirit my making videos of you dancing or other things.	8
07-Apr-2020	i love it i even have made some videos of my own but the only reason it's not getting a full 5 stars is that you can only like a certain amount of videos.	6
11-Apr-2020	i love when people text me a tik tok link and the wrong video plays. but the 2nd time i access it works. i'm convinced this is by design so i'm forced to watch stupid sponsored content. despicable	-1
14-Apr-2020	this is the very entertaining app all its features is very good but i want developers to make a tool for cleaner of self sound video that we make in it this makes it more better.	8
15-Apr-2020	i love this app! this is just the best way to meet new people get followers and likes! so i recommend this app. this has really cool filters and i just love so i think you should get the app!	12
23-Mar-2020	good app and very fun! i love the way you can be creative and upload all of your ideas and others and sharing too.	5
16-Mar-2020	firstly i thought that it was a very boring app until i tried to use it i was no man this app is totally amazing, like you can even save videos so that you can watch even when you're offline	0
25-Apr-2020	this company purposely puts cute/handsom/pretty people on the for you page. this makes the app is no longer enjoyable its only pov's and dances no funny content is uploaded that we can see. well this is an issue beacuse people miss all of that joy including me. so i would just like starting deleting the app to show justice. i know its a little over the top but i wont rest untill justice is upon us.	12
29-Mar-2020	really nice and inspirational to see so many people dojng what they love and enjoying it, whether its dancing, singing, makeup or comedy, its incredible.	10
03-Apr-2020	this is a very good app but since your last update im facing network connection issues and my internet connection is fine i cant contact the support by the app becuase its not runnin
